POST ID: 1isflb3 / POST TITLE: Balancing Technical Skills with Communication
====================================================================================================
One thing I’ve learned over the years is that even if someone is a rockstar at pentesting or threat hunting it doesn’t necessarily make them a great cybersecurity professional unless they can communicate effectively.

It’s not just about “dumbing down” the details, it’s about translating technical risks into business impacts so that management, legal teams, and other stakeholders can actually understand what’s going on. I’ve seen the best technical arguments fall on deaf ears simply because they weren’t framed in a way that connected with the audience’s priorities.

I’m curious: what strategies have you all found helpful for bridging that gap between deeply technical knowledge and a broader business perspective? Do you rely on specific frameworks or methodologies that help outline risk in more accessible terms? Any favorite tips or resources you’d recommend for sharpening your communication skills,especially when talking with non-technical execs?
