POST ID: 1ipnr5w / POST TITLE: What cybersecurity challenges does your small business face?
====================================================================================================
I'm a university student working on my cybersecurity research project, and I'm really interested in understanding the unique security challenges that small businesses face. We hear a lot about big company breaches in the news, but I want to learn more about what's actually happening with smaller businesses like yours. I've created a short anonymous survey to gather insights about your experiences with cybersecurity threats and challenges. The results will be used for my research project, but more importantly, I'll be creating a comprehensive breakdown of the findings that focuses on practical insights for small business owners. I'll share this follow-up post in about 3 days, which will include common threats you're all facing, what security measures are working for others in your position, and key trends I've noticed. My goal is to give you all actionable information about what real threats are out there and how other small businesses are dealing with them. The survey only takes about 3 minutes to complete, and your input would be incredibly valuable - both for my research and for helping fellow small business owners protect themselves. Thanks in advance for your help!
