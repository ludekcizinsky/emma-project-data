Bug bounties other than web

Hey I am interested in big bounty but donâ€™t want to go into the web app pentesting side of it cause I feel thereâ€™s more competition and its not my cup of tea. I love digging deep in files using linux command line basically forensics. I know basic C, Python and can learn any other language if needed as its just understanding the syntax, I know networking stuff.
Just wanted to know which areas would suit me I just want to get started and please mention some sites where I could hunt and get responses.
Any input will be appreciated.
Thank you ðŸ’–
