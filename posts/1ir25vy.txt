POST ID: 1ir25vy / POST TITLE: If You Could Restart Your Cryptography Journey, What Would You Do Differently?
====================================================================================================
Imagine you’re starting cryptography from scratch-knowing what you know now, what would you do differently? Would you focus more on math, coding, or real-world applications? Any underrated resources or mistakes to avoid?

If you could give your younger self one golden piece of advice about learning cryptography, what would it be?

I’d love to hear insights from professionals and enthusiasts alike!
