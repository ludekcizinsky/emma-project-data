COMMENT TEXT: Um…. So….. govcloud has a known breach that is not under mitigation? 

So…not to be alarmist…but doesn’t that mean FISMA, FedRamp HIGH, and every other cert is pretty much as dead as CISA? 

My question - which CTO or CSO is going to continue signing off on the ATOs with this known breach and are they willing to accept the consequences? If they do knowingly sign those ATOs, do they, the authority, now constitute a new known vulnerability since they are clearly incompetent?

COMMENT TEXT: I’m very confused on what it’s trying to imply by GovCloud IPs having APIs to some AI website? GovCloud is literally no different than commercial AWS it just has the security requirements to run things that can be used wrt gov handling requirements. Any company can run whatever they want in GovCloud. How does this indicate “a firehose of data” in any way whatsoever? It just means a random ec2 box in GovCloud which includes commercial entities infrastructure happens to be this ai application not that anything at all is sending data to it. That’s like saying that the entire internet is sending data to Reddit just because they’re on AWS.

Probably lots of metadata about the purchase as well.  Interesting there's a path for Okta, Slack, Google etc.  Wouldn't be surprising if something was left wide open, just need someone better with API's to find it.

COMMENT TEXT: Ok, someone please explain a few things to me.

> Beginning on January 8, 2025, a surge of U.S. government infrastructure began appearing on what’s known as “the search engine of Internet-connected devices,” Shodan.io.

Long before Trump took office and DOGE existed in any actual capacity to have access into government systems. 

> Between January 14 and February 8, servers belonging to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility, and Fermi Accelerator National Laboratory have been found with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) services exposed to the public internet.

Ditto. This was during the Biden administration. How is the author of this article blaming this on DOGE?

> This grants malicious actors the opportunity to hack into servers hosting sensitive nuclear research data, a golden egg for spy agencies across the globe.

Ok, nice claim there. But take it up with the Biden administration. 

> On January 14 and continuing to present, TIGTA’s server used for conducting meetings are publicly exposed.

Ditto.

I don't have a paid membership to Shodan to see various timeline data on his other claims to really verify his claims on when some of these systems first appeared, but I'd be willing to bet many of these have been online and on the public internet for some time, and the author doesn't realize the data on those links is when it was LAST SEEN, not FIRST SEEN.

Now he mentions API connections to Inventry.ai.

> This is a stunning breach of Americans’ privacy that likely breaks multiple federal laws, including the 1974 Privacy Act, the Federal Information Security Management Act, the E-Government Act, and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, among others.

None of these laws prohibit the government from engaging with private companies and sharing PII, provided the company meets certain requirements. How do we know if Inventry.ai does or does not meet these requirements? And how do we know this has ANYTHING remotely to do with DOGE? We don't.

This sounds like just another left-leaning hit piece on Trump and DOGE, frankly, written by someone who doesn't even really know what they're talking about. I'm sure I'll get downvoted into oblivion. But the writer of this article has no idea what they're talking about (which is clear since they made multiple claims of issues that took place BEFORE Trump even took office). Others - the author has no idea what these servers actually do, why they might have been exposed to the internet - whether intentional or not - what data they contain, etc. But the fact of the matter is your data is not being held "hostage". The people elected Trump on a campaign promise to create DOGE and audit the federal government. Trump was elected by the people. Elon is a White House Office special advisor - does not even technically work for DOGE. He is not the DOGE Administrator - that is someone else. Trump has the authority to appoint these people and assign them this task. Elon has Top Secret clearance granted to him by Biden actually. Other people involved have the necessary clearances as well. Plain and simple. Why are we acting like private citizens contracted by the government are never granted access to data in these systems and given access to this data? Joe Blow working at the DMV for $12.50 an hour has access to your personal information too, ya know?

And frankly, they're doing a bang up job at finding government waste at this point - a task no one else in the history of our government has been able to accomplish. If you're trying to act all paranoid that your social security number might get leaked on the internet - give me a break. We all know damn good and well every one of our social security numbers and most other personal data are already out there from 10,000 past leaks (Equifax, anyone?).

COMMENT TEXT: No. As best I can tell, all the original author discovered were hosts in gov cloud responding on a typical http upstream port with a response shodan thinks is inventry.ai. 

All that really means at worst is that the company inventryai is running services in gov cloud.  It does not imply that there is any sort of data egress to it from the actual us government. 

The rest of the discovered hosts, rdp, etc are concerning, though again not one of the gov hosts he linked has any identified vuln.

COMMENT TEXT: No, obviously this does not make someone hackerman. What it does do is require a compliance document update and security assessment. Not anyone can set up a govcloud account. Anyone can setup an aws account. They are not the same, even though the interfaces and such are. 

Govcloud, depending on the level, have physically partjoned systems. I cant use the same hardware powering my dumb personal website cdn on the same hardware powering Va.gov. Govcloud does not have all of the tools and services that normal aws has. 

What the above does is connect an unknown, non-compliant endpoint to a protected network and controlled system. Forgetting the security implications for a second, the ATO is 100% invalid. (Compliance is obviously not security, but this is not the best security practice either)

COMMENT TEXT: The shodan references linked at the end for "ThE NuClEAr LaBs" are also just Joe Schmoe's personal server that has a fake federal banner on the FTP port... The entire article is nonsense written by someone who is acting like they know what they're talking about, shared by a Photographer on Bluesky, who likely also doesn't understand it all completely, and then re-shared here as if it were real news and people are outraged at the headline alone, which is something that hasn't even surely happened. Now I'm being called a "Muskrat" by people in threads here because I understand how technology works (spoiler: I personally dislike Musk very much, so y'all can miss me with your far left dogmatic chants). The date ranges are all even before Trump was even president ffs! Did no one actually read the article?

COMMENT TEXT: >Azure is not AWS GovCloud the two are unrelated

You're missing the context?

I think the point you're missing is what DOGE is actually rampantly *doing* and the expansive nature of what that means for the entire United States' infrastructure.  Especially under the direction of a foreign adversary, namely Putin.

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/elon-musk-s-secret-conversations-with-vladimir-putin/ar-AA1sSO1O

Do you not understand the coup that's happening right now?

>I didn’t say a word about Musk or Bezos, and that article only speaks about only one of them as well.

Again, the point is Musk's DOGE is pushing our private government data into AI systems and we already know they've massively bungled the handling of this process with security and privacy measures being thrown into the shitter.  How *convenient* for Putin to have a wealthy [sociopath Nazi](https://streamable.com/rxfimj) do this for him.

Bezos (who has pledged fealty to the treasonous Trump regime) lords over Amazon's GovCloud that you claim is "literally no different than commercial AWS" even though it contains contains *Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret* data with over 7,500 government agencies using it.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

Also here's a list of companies that utilize GovCloud in regard to governmental and quasi-governmental data:

https://theirstack.com/en/technology/aws-govcloud

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

This GovCloud data contains *Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret* data.  That means investigative data on political orgs (leftist and otherwise), etc. will very likely be included.

This goes far beyond Musk getting access to our SS numbers, income, etc. — This data rug ties the whole fascist room together in a incredibly suppressive, dangerous way.

Hitler could have only dreamed of having this much power.  We need to fight this and people need to understand the stakes.

COMMENT TEXT: Supposedly. I'm not going to go digging around govcloud's ip blocks to find out, though I guess if CISAs not intact.. I've been seeing a lot of stories from people that jump to conclusions though, misinformation for clicks I guess.

In one case, they allege "Alarmingly, a DoE allowed anonymous login with **write access**" and link a server on shodan that has a "This is a Federal computer system and is the property of the United States Government." login banner, but people put those on their servers for fun - the SSL cert is Sectigo issued, it's a wordpress theme site 'EnergeticFields.org'. ARIN has the IP as Charter. Looks like nonsense. 

They also claim " 8 IP addresses on Amazon’s GovCloud now point to Inventry.ai’s REST API, indicating a massive firehose of data being sent to the AI company’s servers. The IP addresses are: 18.253.166.131, 182.30.117.29, 18.253.153.187, 182.30.154.252, 18.254.229.158, 18.253.160.247, 18.254.175.18, 18.254.191.201"

That's an odd way to word that ("pointed at" vs "there are EC2 instances running", unless it's a reverse proxy), but looking at shodan, they're listening on tcp/3000, there's indeed a REST API there with an /openapi.json endpoint, and the API is auth'd. I don't have a timeline sub to see what was there before though. Could be true. We can't confirm netflow/ingress of course.

I'm not sure why a bunch of machines would start showing up as public facing though - even with what they are doing, they'd have to be messing with the edge and that would just be very odd. If they're vacuuming up a bunch of data, they're likely pushing it rather than pulling it.

COMMENT TEXT: I'm missing no context, trust me, I'm following political happenings very closely, but you're applying unrelated context to my simple question about a claim. My original question had nothing even at all to do with DOGE, or Musk, or Bezos, my guy, stop pushing your political grandstanding into this thread, please. It's about the claims of the OP.

If people are going to share posts about "cybersecurity" saying "the sky is falling because <foo>" then <foo> should at least make sense. 

The OP in this thread, that I am speaking about, and you seem to not be, is the claim about "IPs in GovCloud happen to be inventry apis" and "indicating a massive firehose of data being sent to the AI company’s servers" - what indicates that? There is nothing presented that indicates that at all.

That list of "GovCloud utilization" is far from being true or complete as I have worked at two companies prior that run in GovCloud and neither is on that list, nor any of the hundreds if not thousands of GovCloud customers we served including federal, state, and city government agencies. It's just AWS "for gov" - that's it. It's not some shared resource or singular entity. It's literally just the same AWS platform, with the same AWS console that AWS has gone through the hoops required to get their infra and systems certified to host the higher level clearance applications, and to get any actual gov customers or handle any gov related data, you yourself also need to go through the hoops to get your application itself certified running on top of it - being "in GovCloud" alone does not certify you for Gov data handling, just AWS's side is already certified so you only have to worry about your usage itself. Inventry simply having endpoints in GovCloud is meaningless. It does not mean anyone is sending anything to it. They could be in auditing right now, or still planning on it and setting up, but without certification no government data, users, or anything can start contracts with them. Them simply running/existing in GovCloud, by itself, as a claim, is meaningless.

Nothing that you are saying answers my question or refutes anything I've said. You just keep coming back yelling about Nazis and Elon and Bezos, none of which I'm currently talking about, and just trying to ask how these claims were come to be made about this AI platform being used in any way shape or form by DOGE. 

The answer to "what's the implied significance of this GovCloud IP finding, when GovCloud is literally just AWS" is not "Hitler!"

The idiotic way those things have gone definitely makes me worried about their technical knowledge/practices.

BUT this specific substack also appears to be written by someone with only surficial technical knowledge. It looks like they found certain terms in the banner and then didn't actually do the rest of the steps to verify which hits were legit.

That invertry ai api endpoint was the most interesting thing imo and I'd love to see someone with more knowledge do a followup to this article doing a more thorough examination of each claim.

Stop lying.

FACT: Inventry.ai is owned by private equity.

FACT: Inventry.ai has only been in operation for a few years.

FACT: Evidence shows Inventry.ai is connected to GovCloud

FACT: GovCloud is not going to connect to Inventry.ai for shits and giggles.

FACT: If you think only a trickle of data is needed by ML to make sense of data, [then you need to brush up](https://postindustria.com/how-much-data-is-required-for-machine-learning/).

We're done here, Muskrat liar.

The rest is my older reply below:


>It's just AWS "for gov" - that's it ... when GovCloud is literally just AWS" is not "Hitler!"

" ... Delivering a high-availability cloud technology with the security and reliability governments need across all classification levels: Unclassified, **Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret** ... "

How about some context you're avoiding? With one "little" difference that GovCloud contains critically sensitive quasi-governmental and governmental data including data via 3-letter agencies.

The concern is (in *context* of DOGE) is that we see (at the very least) evidence that GovCloud is connected to a fly-by-night private equity AI company potentially sending extremely sensitive government data to be processed (or whatever) by AI which has severe security/privacy ramifications especially in light of what DOGE has been haphazardly doing with AI and government data in the same vein.

It's stunningly weird to continue to ignore that context.

> I'm missing no context, trust me

You still don't seem to grasp the context of how expansive DOGE is and are blowing off a literal technofascist coup as "the sky is falling".  Have you heard of RAGE?  Have you heard of "network states"?  Do you not understand the ramifications of this in context?

You're either missing it — or dodging it.

If you think only a trickle of data is needed by ML to make sense of data, [then you need to brush up](https://postindustria.com/how-much-data-is-required-for-machine-learning/).  Either way, I'm looking at the big picture that you want to brush off:

In *context* of what is going on with DOGE, the sharing of government data from GovCloud to a fly-by-night, *private equity* AI company is alarming to say the least.

Bezos has pledged fealty to a *treasonous* Musk/Trump regime dismantling our democratic institutions obviously in benefit of Russia among other foreign adversaries. Giving Bezos benefit of the doubt on what his GovCloud is doing connected to a fly-by-night private equity AI entity is foolhardy.

Given the stakes that our nation's infrastructure is being actively attacked and treacherously dismantled by the Trump regime billionaire funders/collaborators — we're not going to blow this off and move on.

There needs to be transparency on this so we're not digging around trying to figure out what's going on ourselves, but that's unfortunately how it works within a fascist oligarchy/dictatorship.

I hope you continue to dig into the details of it.  When you find out more from the actual OP (not the Reddit OP) I hope you share your findings honestly and in context of a fascist coup.  To ignore that aspect in all of this is ridiculous at best and absolute cowardly denial at worst — I can't believe I even have to say this.

GovCloud's own website states that they do — and the FBI and other 3-letter agencies, etc. utilize GovCloud with their data:

 " ... Delivering a high-availability cloud technology with the security and reliability governments need across all classification levels: Unclassified, **Sensitive, Secret, and Top Secret** ... "

It's a simple Internet search to find this.

Anyone who is still putting faith into Musk, Bezos, etc. to keep our government data safe and secure hasn't been paying attention.  And anyone who doesn't think they'll use that data to manipulate/intimidate the public and subjugate dissent has definitely missed their brazen anti-worker/labor actions up until this point.

You keep repeating misinformation at this point, so I'm just going to stop participating in bad faith discussions. 

To reiterate again, in hopes you maybe understand this time: 

A. I've literally worked on applications living within GovCloud, for commercial companies. I know what I'm talking about here, and your quote from the homepage isn't saying anything refuting what I'm saying. 

B. Something running on GovCloud means just as much as something running on vanilla AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, or even in a personal/private datacenter, shit even the same as running on a server in someones basement. It does not mean it has access to anything else running on GovCloud. It does not mean anything in GovCloud is sending data to it. It does not mean anything at all other than that an app is running on a box in that datacenter. GovCloud is not a singular "thing" where everyone just has a shared pool of "top secret" data it can all read from. I can't query Reddit's databases simply by having my "hackReddit" app also running on AWS. GovCloud is simply a hosting platform that is full of private equity and commercial applications serving government contracts, but in order to get those contracts the applications themselves also need a full audit and approval for FedRamp, IL5, etc certifications. Your repeat attempts to say that existing in GovCloud means it has access to top secret data shows that you simply do not understand how technology or hosting providers work, you just want to throw around political outrage, so there's not much we can discuss further.

notice the term air gapped.

COMMENT TEXT: Thanks, and yeah, I did read that source and have no real reason to doubt it. But, I would love to see articles like that corroborated with some actual forensic evidence similar to, but beyond what the OP substack writer tried to do.

My confidence in the media to correctly report on most things, but particularly complex and technical things, is shrinking day by day for a variety of reasons (latest being the COBOL date thing, which imo just discredits the MANY very legitimate criticisms against elon and the doggies). 

So I guess I'm honestly just really desperate for some actual unfiltered, verifiable evidence for my own sanity and because I truly think the inability to agree on any kind of shared reality is seriously fucking up our democracy and sensibilities. 

Not sure if hard evidence can even fix that lack of shared reality anymore, but feels like its either that or eliminating the entire current social media model lol

COMMENT TEXT: Fair enough, I understand where you're coming from.

>latest being the COBOL date thing, which imo just discredits the MANY very legitimate criticisms against elon and the doggies

From what I've seen it's not likely a COBOL date thing, but probably a COBOL data design issue and even more likely a deal where things have been modified with policy changes over the decades and it's become a complex (but workable) beast in the process.

That's exactly why they shouldn't have fired the people who had a grasp of the systems and processes unless *their point* was to obfuscate typical government processes and purposefully confuse it with fraud in order to dismantle government in their *very obvious* techno-fascist coup.

The problem is people don't understand that these critical systems are meant to run with 100% "uptime" to get out payments *no matter fucking what*.  It's not a porn server where a small amount of website downtime and/or disruption of backend payment services is acceptable.  That means the overall system is most certainly going to have some patched on "inefficiencies" compared to a porn server, but it will still function *solidly* for the greater good.  When people lose their porn, they don't fucking die.  That's why people don't run a government like a business unless they're mentally ill, megalomaniacal evil idiots (see Musk/Trump) addicted to attaining more and *more* money/power like heroin addicts.

Sure, the media is making mistakes about COBOL, etc. as it's well over the heads of most people and especially the media  — but they're going to report what's handed to them especially when it's over their heads to vet it out.

This tactic from Musk is typical, *purposefully obtuse* fascist behavior where he makes unsubstantiated, outrageous claims and throws out numbers without backup.  That tactic leaves everyone else wasting time and effort to scramble to figure out his bullshit.  Mistakes will be made in the desperate attempt to make sense of his claims (and those mistakes will cynically become the focus) and he succeeds in his fascist distraction machine.

Either way, Musk has been shown to be talking out of his ass without having any real evidence of substantial fraud.  The point the public needs to understand is he's attempting a coup to dismantle our government and implement RAGE (look it up) with DOGE.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

In other words, it's vastly faster and easier to break things than to build them.  I'm not going to shit on people who in good faith are trying to figure out what the fuck a ~~bad~~ evil faith actor like Musk is claiming by him just throwing bullshit after bullshit against the wall.  He's not even doing it to see "what sticks" — it's a rapid-fire, gish gallop approach to authoritarianism.

It's been a part of their fascist game plan for a long time now and even some of the chuckleheads on FOX News are bragging about it due to their extreme hubris.
