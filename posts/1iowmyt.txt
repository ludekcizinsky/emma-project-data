POST ID: 1iowmyt / POST TITLE: Cyber Attacks on US Ports Could Cost Billions Daily
====================================================================================================
The U.S. Coast Guard is being pushed to tighten cybersecurity for the Maritime Transportation System (MTS), which moves over $5 trillion in goods every year.A new report warns that ports and vessels are vulnerable to cyberattacks from countries like China, Russia, and North Korea. A successful cyberattack shutting down port operations could cost the local economy up to $2 billion per day, according to Long Beach Port CEO Mario Cordero. He shared this concern with [CBS News ](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chinese-cranes-at-u-s-ports-raise-homeland-security-concerns/)while they investigated the potential risks of Chinese-made ship-to-shore cranes being vulnerable to hackers.

The Government Accountability Office says the Coast Guard needs a clearer cybersecurity strategy, better data management, and improved training to close security gaps. With ports like Los Angeles already facing millions of cyberattacks monthly, experts say stronger defenses are urgently needed. Itâ€™s wild to think how much damage a single attack could cause. Our economy and security are on the line, but are we doing enough to protect them?
