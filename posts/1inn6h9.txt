POST ID: 1inn6h9 / POST TITLE: Ex-SOC Analyst Trying to Get Back in the Game â€“ Need Advice
====================================================================================================
Hey everyone,

I need some advice . I was a SOC Analyst for 2.5 years at an Indian MNC, mainly working in IAM (Identity & Access Management), automation, and support for a Canadian client. 

My daily grind involved:

â€¢RBAC, Access Control, RSA tokens

â€¢Active Directory, NetIQ (yes, I know itâ€™s ancient), and some L1 exposure to CyberArk

â€¢ Incident management, handling on-call issues, and server checks (Solaris/Linux)

I took a break to prep for competitive exams, but that didnâ€™t work out, and now Iâ€™m back in the job market. Given the rapid changes in cybersecurity, I want to re-enter the field the right wayâ€”but without spending a ton on expensive certs right away.

Need guidance on:

	1.	**Interview Prep** â€“ What areas should I focus on given my IAM-heavy background? Should I brush up on things like SIEM (Splunk/QRadar), endpoint security, or shift towards cloud IAM? Any must-know topics for todayâ€™s job market?

	2.	**Certifications (On a Budget)** â€“ I was considering AWS Cloud Cert, but should I go for AWS, GCP, or Azure? Would Azure Security/Identity certs be more relevant for IAM roles? Are there any quick, low-cost certs that could add value?

	3.	**Technical Refresh** â€“ Since I worked more on IAM and automation, should I focus on scripting (Python/PowerShell), Cloud Security, or even diving into PAM solutions like CyberArk/BeyondTrust? Any Udemy courses or hands-on labs youâ€™d recommend?

	4.	**Current Trends** â€“ The field is shifting towards Zero Trust, Cloud IAM, and DevSecOpsâ€”should I start looking into these areas? 
*How do I best position myself for roles that are hiring in 2025?*


Thanks so much ðŸŒ¸
