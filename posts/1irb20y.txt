POST ID: 1irb20y / POST TITLE: Is there still a major issue on training and awareness?
====================================================================================================
Did some research for six months. I asked dome friends at there job locations to take a few notes to answer some questions, bearing in mind they aren't experts:

1. Do staff talk about security online/digital world?
2. Is there any equipment you see on-site that isn't secure, usually a mini server?
3. Start a conversion about online scammers, does the conversation last more than 3 minutes?
4. What training does the bisunesses talk about when it comes to online protection, example, phishing emails.

After se feeedback, i admit on a small scale, lots of bisunesses doing phishing email practice bits, but that's all I've seen there seems to be no more training in any areas, for example basic social engineering exams.

It seems to me there is a hole and opportunity for someone to fill on offering better basic training for non technical groups/bisunesses. Would I be wrong and wasting my time if I were considering to pursue this gap?
