====================================================================================================
I did a beginner networking course last year and was really interest in Linuxâ€™s abilities. I did the free tryhackme beginner path but was of course Meg by a pay wall. I was wondering if there were any open source ethical hacking beginner courses that someone with experience would recommend to me. I only have experience with Ubuntu on a vm.
