POST ID: 1ioyjiw / POST TITLE: Engineering to Cyber Security
====================================================================================================
I am a senior systems test engineer with about 8 years of experience in the field. I have mostly DOD experience with different types of projects and knowledge under my belt. I just passed my Sec + exam since I want to work more with my hands on computers and I love analyzing/finding data and like a challenge which Cyber seems like the perfect route for me. My issue is, am I going to go all the way back down to like entry level help desk roles once I apply to jobs? Will any of my skills be able to transfer so I don't have to take such a massive pay decrease?
