POST ID: 1iom9ra / POST TITLE: What do you say to someone who's convinced a password manager is bad for them?
====================================================================================================
Let's call him Bob.

Bob likes using his personal "password system" and it does generate traditionally strong passwords that are unique for every site.

Now Bob knows that password managers are out there, but doesn't like them because:

1. Many are paid
2. They require a tool and that tool isn't going to be where he is all the time
3. 2FA is stronger anyway
4. Centralizing passwords with a 3rd party is a risk.

And that's basically it. Bob wants to be able to log in to his accounts from any computer anywhere any time and the password manager is a delay or block to doing that. If he's at his parent's house and needs to check his mail; blocked. Print a ticket at the hotel business center; blocked. At work where he can't use the manager; blocked.

Bob understands the security advantage, but doesn't see that it's worth it when his passwords are "good enough".

What would you say to someone in this situation?
