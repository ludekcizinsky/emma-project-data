COMMENT TEXT: Iâ€™m still a novice myself but spending a few months delving into Linux has given me some solid fundamentals. I use hack the box which is fun and give you hands on experience with the tools you will be using such as nmap and burpsuite.

COMMENT TEXT: comptia doesn't have a CCNA cert as CCNA is through CISCO. you'll want to start with A+ and NET + and SEC+.

COMMENT TEXT: I recommend tryhackme to get started and understanding some concepts. From their trying to get some basic certifications like eJPT, Security+. I also recommend TCM academy, I used this while I was studying in University and found it very helpful and it ended up allowing me to pass my OSCP
