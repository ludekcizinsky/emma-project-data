POST ID: 1btm6t4 / POST TITLE: Hey I was wondering about hacking my own phone   
====================================================================================================
I have a phone I want to learn how to remotely hack my phone without access to device    just because can anyone teach me how to do this the phone is  in my name and the service is in my name. So it is ethical to do this without getting into any trouble.

COMMENT TEXT: no one will teach you because you wont learn anything. hacking in general requires you to be able to do your own research and learning from that research, Though people can point you in the right direction. i'll point you in the right direction, look up bluetooth hacking. its a pretty interesting concept.

COMMENT TEXT: Not trying to sound mean or anything, but one of the prerequisite skills needed for this, and any IT based hobby/job, is being able to look things up yourself.

I'd start with researching Linux I guess. Personally, I dove right in and just installed it and forced myself to use it, which also made my google-fu skills better.

It's a pretty long journey, and there isn't really any shortcuts man :/
