POST ID: 15u1b13 / POST TITLE: Certification inquiry.
====================================================================================================
I have an extensive experience with computers, but have no idea what certifications or courses would be meaningful or relevant to the field of cybersecurity. Iâ€™m interested in analysis, threat assessments, pen testing, and even forensic data recovery methods. Any advice or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

COMMENT TEXT: The stickied post '[Interested in joining the ethical hacking community](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethicalhacking/comments/lkso1z/interested_in_joining_the_ethical_hacking/)' is still very much relevant for this.  There's a link to a certification roadmap video that's a good watch for what you're looking for.
