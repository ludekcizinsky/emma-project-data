====================================================================================================
Hello, can you recommend the best ethical hacking and cybersecurity courses that you know, I am looking for options to obtain good certifications. 


PS: It has to be in Spanish because they are actually for my dad and he doesn't speak English.... 

Thank you ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹

COMMENT TEXT: Tryhackme and tcm academy are great places to start learning. Not sure if they have translated lessons but you can always run the text through a translator till he learns more English.
