POST ID: 1ireoc7 / POST TITLE: What’s the Most Overlooked Security Risk in Small Companies?
====================================================================================================
Most small businesses focus on the basics—firewalls, antivirus, and maybe some employee training—but what’s the biggest security risk that often gets ignored?

From your experience, what’s the weak spot that goes unnoticed until it’s too late? A few I’ve seen mentioned:

* **Unmanaged Shadow IT** – Employees using personal devices or unapproved software.
* **Lack of Monitoring** – No real visibility into logs, failed login attempts, or suspicious activity.
* **Phishing & Social Engineering** – Still one of the easiest ways to breach a company.
* **Poor Access Control** – Overprivileged accounts, no MFA, or shared credentials.
* **Third-Party Risk** – Vendors or partners with weak security exposing your business.

What do you think is the most underrated security gap that small businesses should take seriously? Any real-world examples you’ve seen?
