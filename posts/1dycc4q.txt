POST ID: 1dycc4q / POST TITLE: Are paid proxies the only option?
====================================================================================================
I'm currently learning and new to this field . It's been confusing for me since the free proxies are not trustworthy and the paid ones are a bit expensive . Any suggestions on this?

COMMENT TEXT: Depends on why you want one I guess. I can't really think of a reason to use a proxy beyond password spraying, but that's omega cheap (1 million requests are $1 through an Amazon gateway).
