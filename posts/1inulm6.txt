POST ID: 1inulm6 / POST TITLE: Have You Been a Victim of Cybercrime? Weâ€™d Love to Hear Your Story for an IGCSE Project
====================================================================================================
Hi everyone,

We are a group of students working on our IGCSE Global Perspectives Team Project, and our topic is **cybercrime**. We are researching the real-life impact of cybercrime and would love to hear from individuals who have experienced it firsthand.

If you have been a victim of cybercrime (e.g., online scams, identity theft, hacking, etc.), we would greatly appreciate it if you could share your experience. Your insights will help us understand the personal and societal effects of cybercrime.

Your identity will remain **anonymous**, and we will only use the information for educational purposes. If you are comfortable sharing, please comment below or message us directly.

Thank you for your time!
