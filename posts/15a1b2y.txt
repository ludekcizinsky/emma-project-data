POST ID: 15a1b2y / POST TITLE: Should I learn ethical hacking?
====================================================================================================
I'm kinda interested in it, have the free time but trying to do so many things LOL. Lots of hobbies. 

I did programmer boot camp so I understand techy stuff decently.

What are the benefits? Is it fun? 

Yes i know movies really exaggerate it. 

What is learning curve?

COMMENT TEXT: It's fun but it's hard work, If you're just now starting out I would look at a security+ class just to get your feet wet.

I would start with simple stuff like attacking a virtual machine and learn how to crack a password
