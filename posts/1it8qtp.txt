POST ID: 1it8qtp / POST TITLE: What is the importance of mathematics and statistics in infosec?
====================================================================================================
While browsing some job openings on LinkedIn, I noticed a vacancy from Microsoft for a Security Operator Engineer, and among the higher education requirements were Mathematics, Statistics, or Computer Science. I didnâ€™t quite understand how that fits in. How is it used?

For roles such as security engineer, malware analyst, and cryptography analyst, is a degree in statistics really important?

Are there other areas of infosec in which knowledge of statistics is a strong asset?
