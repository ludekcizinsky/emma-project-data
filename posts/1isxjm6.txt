====================================================================================================
Things like heavy work load? Difficulty with how to manage problems. Discovering how hackers exploited your system etc.  What problems do you guys face in the cybersecurity work space and what are some pros to working in this field? I'm sure it can't all be bad but from what I can judge based off feelings is it will be a strong workload. What do you guys think?
