POST ID: 1iw6vw1 / POST TITLE: Has SnoopGod Linux Been Discontinued?
====================================================================================================
Hey everyone,

I’ve been a fan of SnoopGod Linux for a while now, and it’s been my go-to distro for security-focused tasks. However, I’ve noticed that there hasn’t been much activity or updates lately. The official website is down, and I can’t find any recent news or announcements from the developers.

Does anyone know if SnoopGod Linux has been discontinued? Or is the project just on hiatus? I’d hate to see such a unique and niche distro fade away, especially with its focus on penetration testing and cybersecurity.

If anyone has any info or insights, I’d appreciate it! Also, if it is discontinued, are there any similar distros you’d recommend as an alternative?

Thanks in advance!
