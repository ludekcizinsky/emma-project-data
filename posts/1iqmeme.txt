How do you deal with the impostor syndrome while also knowing that everybody here seems to have seen it all and know it all?

I have recently picked up hack the box, and I find myself not able to follow through so quickly as I would expect, given that I have devoted more than 9 years into this field already (blue team). This has demolished my confidence. I feel like a fraud. I recently started to call myself a Cybersecurity Clown. Maybe I should just embrace it and show up as an actual clown into my next job interview.
