COMMENT TEXT: Hey there, so I am trying to go through a career change (26M). I've started taking some courses through coursera for CS like Google CS, AI For CS, Python, Network Security and a whole bunch of others. Here's my problem, I know no one in this field. So I am curious, can I get a job in CS with all these and some other CERTS? If not, how can I get into the field? I really do not want to take years out of my life at this point to pursue a bachlors. I would be more inclined to do so if I could get an entry level position in CS first. Then pursue that on the side. Any advice?

COMMENT TEXT: Good evening, everyone. I am currently going to school for IT, (cybersecurity & networking specifically). I have a history of only blue-collar jobs and I feel so alienated going to school with people who have grown up building computers and have extensive experience with tinkering with computers and I feel light years behind the ball. Lately, I have started watching PC build videos, and intro to networking playlists on YouTube just to try to surround myself with IT information.

I am looking for advice, things to watch, listen to, get into, and just general suggestions on what to do to further envelop myself in the IT culture.

COMMENT TEXT: Good Morning Cyber Community,

I am transiting into cybersecurity after many years of working in the entertainment business. 

In December I received my CompTIA Security+ Certification and recently passed my MS-900, gaining fundamental knowledge of Azure and Microsoft 365, Microsoft’s cloud based resources. 

My overall goal is to eventually work as a threat analyst, learn the in’s- and-out’s for a few years and then work as an engineer. I’m okay starting at the bottom and working my way up. 

My question is, with my CompTIA Security+ Certification, Microsoft Azure Certification and Google Technical Support Certification, which roles should I be applying for when seeking my first job in tech? Outside of the labs I had to complete during my courses, I have no real world tech experience. 

I currently live in Las Vegas, I’m always hearing that the Casinos and Hotels need cybersecurity personnel but most of the jobs seem to require 3-5 years of experience.

Where should I start? Which roles should I be applying for?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated…

COMMENT TEXT: Hi Everyone - I'm currently a worried, job insecure civilian Fed working in cyber and IT procurement with several years experience. I'm concerned that experience will be for nothing once Elon is through destroying the government and all its security standards. I was an ISSO for 3 years before (again, civilian agency), and a systems assessor before that (NIST 800-53). In your opinion, should I: 

1. Transition to DoD work, hoping those standards and investments won't be killed regardless of the political persuasion of the White House? Only problem there is I don't live in the DC Metro area. I don't have DoD experience or Secret clearance or anything - any advice in breaking in there?
2. Transition to private sector GRC work? Again, I need to somehow break into that field (no ISO, GDPR, SOX experience, unfortunately, so advice would be appreciated)
3. Transition to cyber engineering? I only really have a compliance background and haven't really done the nuts and bolts of implementation (like say, setting up a key vault in Azure or anything). I see lots of jobs for engineers. Any pro-tips?
4. Flee to South America with my family and open a beach bar? (Only semi-kidding about that).

I have CISSP and Sec+ and technical writing background too, if that helps.

COMMENT TEXT: Need Some Clarification On Asymmetric Encryption Understanding if someone wouldn’t mind helping!


So I’m a little ways into my cyber security course and had a question about this.

My understanding of this was a bit confusing so I wrote out an illustrative example of my understanding and wanted to check if it’s correct.


*So In illustrative terms, I have my own unique “locks” (public key) I can send out to people,

They can use this custom lock I have to lock a treasure chest and send that chest to me.

But I am the only one who has the key (private key) to those custom locks.

Therefore I can give each person who wants to send me a treasure chest a custom lock and even though they all have the same custom lock, I’m the only one with the key to open them.*

As goofy as it sounds, I have an easier time learning when breaking it down into something more illustrative.

Hello,

Yes I’m posting this in another subreddit but just for more information.

This is even embarrassing to talk about and yes I know I am a POS for my actions.

I am currently getting a degree in cyber security but I was charged with an assault 4th degree dc(domestic violence). I am pretty sure I am unable to get this expunged. 
My question is am I still able to get a job in cybersecurity or should I just change my major before I finish it? Also if I am able to get a job am I able to advance through this field with promotions and such.

Thank you

Hi everyone! I’m deciding between a Diploma in Networking Technology and a Diploma in Information Technology, and I want to pursue a career in cybersecurity.

Which diploma would provide the best foundation for getting into cybersecurity? Does Networking Technology give a strong starting point, or should I go for a more general IT diploma and specialize later?

COMMENT TEXT: Career guidance

23M working as network security researcher in a product based company (legacy product) since 3 yrs
-no promotion/good pay
-no learning due to a lot of work load as team size shrunk
-no guidance bcz there are no seniors to work well and learn from them.


I got an offer in a contract company, we will work in well known IDs/ips teams as contract workers:

-the work I'll do here is something I've already done long back at my present company.
-contract based so there won't be full access to the product to learn new things or add to my resume.
-they might not take us as full time employees and it'll be same mundane routine work till I move out of this new org.

+100% hike in salary 
+Bcz I've done this work already, I'll save half day everyday (from info I got calculations I can make). So I'm thinking to use my remaining time to write blogs on research, do GMAT, oscp, grem,...

Now I'm in a dilemma thinking:
1. If it'll make my job shift to better companies further if I'm going to be in this contract company.?
2. Will my resume be impacted if it has experience as a contract worker.?


Please advise and give pointers that'll help me out of this dilemma.

COMMENT TEXT: I'm currently looking for a new job, and trying to figure out how to best define myself.  I've been working at GCP for almost five years, focusing on developing infrastructure for onboarding and permissions management.  Prior to that I spent two years working for a small cyber security startup on wireless (802.11) monitoring and intrusion detection.  

At the moment, I'm pretty familiar with IAM and auth for cloud services.  I'm considering moving to a more security-focused role or company.  Can I get some advice for what kind of roles might best suit me and/or what companies I should look at in the SF Bay Area?  I'm a developer that likes to make things, but I'm also interested in the security space and want to figure out how to capitalize on my existing skillset.

COMMENT TEXT: I’m currently working as a full-time Customer Support Specialist in a FinTech start up, and I’m also aiming to transition into cybersecurity. Recently, I got the chance to apply and land an offer for an Identity and Access Management internship. I am wondering if it would be practical to go for an IAM internship to advance to cybersec. I have about a year and a half till i finish Uni.

Here’s the catch:

* I’m already in a full-time role, which provides job stability and a steady income.
* The IAM internship is a 5% increase in pay.
* The internship most likely would give me exposure to cybersecurity tools and concepts like user authentication, permission management, and security audits.
* I’m also interested in IT auditing and eventually transitioning to roles like cybersecurity consultant or even a C-level role in the future.
* I hate my Support Job will all my heart

Should risk the full time role to go for this Internship?

COMMENT TEXT: Career Guidance needed. 

I am about to graduate next month with my BS in Cybersecurity. 

I have: 
A+,
Net+,
Sec+,
ISC2 SSCP (associate due to lack of experience),
LPI Linux Essentials.
I should have Pen+ next month. 

I have been trying to break into the field with internships, helpdesk, anything really to get going with experience and I have not landed a single interview. I've tried, on site roles, hybrid, and remote. I've tried networking on LinkedIn and reaching out to recruiters. I'm located in Ohio, if that makes a difference. 

I would prefer hybrid or remote because I do have a disability that makes it dangerous to drive some days. Sometimes I wonder if marking the "I have a disability box" is really there to just kick my resume out. 

I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. Any advice would be so appreciated! Thank you!

COMMENT TEXT: I’m a 22-year-old currently working toward my Network+ certification While I’m not enrolled in a traditional school, l understand that certifications and experience often hold more weight in IT vs a traditional education, so l’ve been taking online courses from Dion and Messor to build my knowledge for the exam.
I’ve identified some great IT companies in my area and am considering reaching out to managers or department heads to inquire about internship opportunities. My goal is to gain hands-on experience and develop my skills.
My question is—should I start pursuing internships now while studying for my Networkt, or would it be better to wait until I’ve secured the certification? I feel having the cert would strengthen my case for the internship, but gaining experience sooner could also be beneficial. 

whats your advice on this?

COMMENT TEXT: Hello so i will be quick and to the point as the title says i got my first corp job after uni graduation "bachelors in media engineering & technology" aka software engineering.

I tried work as a web developer and later on i found my passion in cybersecurity, since then i got certified Security + , now working on SOC Level 1 on tryachkme and since graduation i am applying to jobs. I applied to over 70 security jobs even admin jobs and technical support, and the only answer i got was from a Digital media distribution company as **a Data Input/Output Specialist.**

My job is to make sure data goes from point A to B on time and securely. There is a lot of security but mostly in practice and not very technical (stopping attacks, exploiting, scripting.. etc). I like the company but for that reason i am afraid i am wasting my knowledge or am overqualified and settling to the only response i got. It feels like a system admin almost fulfilling ticket requests through a queue (as best as i can explain it)

Lastly, I wanna make some things clear i am studying on the side SOC Level 1 and after plan to get CEH certified and applying for masters in germany starting in October but not sure at all to get due to my average bachelor grades. That said i would not like to be wasting my time wether i get accepted and quit or denied as currently between the job and studying i can barely workout but my social life is clapped which i am totally fine with as long as it is worth it. 

So experts of the field enlighten me <3, Thank you

COMMENT TEXT: Hello,

I am seeking advice on choosing between two schools primarily based on the math requirement of each.

Oregon State University requires math 251 and 252. 

Eastern Oregon University does not.

I have taken precalculus many years ago and struggled. I got a C. It was really the first course I took in college that I realized you had to actually put work into outside of just going to class in order to succeed and as a young adult I just did not put in that work.

I am returning to school many years later because I want to finish a bachelors. I have a career as a first responder and work full time nights so I will be completing the degree online and these schools are in partnership with my current CC, transferring will be easy, so that's how I narrowed down these two.

Completing a bachelors is a personal goal and is mainly something to fall back on since I have my first responder career and also possibly could advance in digital forensics in my career.

All that to say, I feel confident that if I wanted to pass calculus I could. I understand I would have to put in a lot of work. I am interested in using kahn academy to brush up on my algebra, pre calc (maybe retake altogether), etc.  I might have to take just the calculus class one semester in order to really focus on it, while managing work full time, but I COULD do it.

Is it worth it though? I am not sure. As stated previously, it's mostly a personal goal to get the degree and a fall back since I have a career. 

Does one degree look better than the other? Is that important? Interested in hearing others advice and opinions. TIA.

Disappointed in: C|CISO

Goal: looking to obtain a CIO or CISO role / executive role before leaving gov service and then get a CIO/CISO roll in the commercial sector.

Currently work for the Government in Cyber. Provided I'm not downsized in one form or another I want to put in another 15 years with the Government before heading back to the commercial sector. Currently put my plans to look for a promotion on hold, even though I am eligible and have been getting green lights in the past few weeks.

Also spending time learning and using AI in any cyber or work related task I can every day. Anything from scripting to analysis to policy review and comparison.

I am planning on an MBA as a must have from a rather good school before I leave gov service. Spoken to several co-workers in my agency and I am disappointed in what I have heard about the C|CISO, doesn't sound difficult at all. One of my co-workers said once he got his CISM, because he already had his CISSP, they gave him the C|CISO. Not the kind of cert I am looking for if they're just going to give it away - I'm looking for the next CISSP level certification. Thoughts?

For those at the higher level what is the current value of the CEH certification, (Certified Ethical Hacker)?

Also Interested in "Chief Technology Officer Programme" from Cambridge University. Has anyone been? Can anyone recommend it? Valuable or expensive resume fluff?

What certs, skills, experience would you recommend for someone who wants to be ready for that 300k-500k+ CISO, CIO Position in 15 years?

COMMENT TEXT: CISO or CRO?

Originally I had thought long term career goals maybe I would want to be a CISO. Recently interviewed for a position at a different company and spoke with their CISO and it was a really good talk but this CISO mentioned if they had to do it all over again they would have went for a Chief Risk Officer role because it is more satisfactory and also more lucrative. Curious to hear if anyone has experience in either of these two roles, what they feel more fulfilled with, and what seems to be more the lucrative option in your opinion.

COMMENT TEXT: Planning to switch my focus from AI to Cybersecurity. DSA is not for me. I feel more inclined towards Cyber security. Although I am starting from scratch; learning networking, cloud and linux fundamentals. Just one question, is it worth it? I am planning to lock in myself after I wasted years behind AI. I am curious to know from you experienced peeps whether Cyber security is worth the struggle and rewarding enough in the long term?!

COMMENT TEXT: Struggling finding job/experience

Hi all, been watching this subreddit for a couple months now, figured it was finally time to ask for some advice.

About 6 months ago now, I graduated online with a degree in cybersecurity from Colorado State. A few months before I graduated,  I started looking for internships, entry level roles, or just any sort of experience to get my foot in the door and let’s just say- it’s been pretty defeating. I spend almost every day applying, messaging people on LinkedIn, emailing, just trying to make a connection to potentially land me something- and it’s been no luck. I have not even been able to land an interview and I’ve probably tried at least 100+ places. Where am I going wrong? What steps should I take?

To talk a little about my background- I’m an operations lead for a catering company in my home town, and I also worked as solutions specialist for Verizon. Other than that, I don’t have much professional experience outside of my associates in business and bachelors in cyber. I don’t have any certs, mostly because all I have seen are pretty pricey + I’m in debt with credit cards and student loans. Is there a certification that’s on the cheaper side (less than 200$?) that could potentially bolster my resume? Honestly looking for any and all advice- definitely at a block in the road here and looking for advice.

One last thing to add - from what I’ve seen on here, cyber isn’t really an entry level field to get into, and I’m best off applying to IT and entry level help desk positions, which I have really focused on the past couple months and still really had no luck.

Thanks in advance for any advice given below , it’s truly appreciated!

COMMENT TEXT: Looking for career advice. 

I’ve been a Security Engineer for about 2.5 years now. My first year I was a junior and was my first professional full time job doing government contracting. After that I was moved into a more senior role as one of two people holding down my companies position on a contract, with the only other person being my team lead.

On each preformance review I’ve done, I’ve either gotten a perfect or near perfect score. I’ve gone out of my way to take any opportunity my company throws my way but ever since I last got officially promoted I’ve felt immensely stagnant and like I’ve lost agency over my career.

The reason for this feeling is because when I got promoted I was told “no certifications or new knowledge will increase your salary or move up your position in the company. You just need to put in the time.” The most I got in terms of things that can increase my agency to move forward in my career is got “get a Masters degree.” This does make some sense, but I’m going for my PhD, so “getting a Masters” is not going to just happen for me. Though I do understand this is my choice and I do recognize that not directly going for a Masters is me choosing my personal interests over my career.

The worst part is that I decided to interview for other companies but I’m either getting rejected for my lack of years of experience or when I do interview, I find the interviewers are asking questions they would a Junior or mid level engineer, and I have no issues answering their questions, but when I get their offers, It is much less than what I make now and for a position less senior.

I want to move forward. I hate how stagnant I feel. I want new challenges. I even have been helping other departments where I can just to have new and interesting challenges to help tackle. I just don’t know what to do with myself. I have started to accept that I may just need to put in years to be accepted into higher roles, but I find it extremely depressing that it has little to do with the quality of the work I do and my knowledge/capabilities.

COMMENT TEXT: Hi I am just doubting on what possible path is better suited for me. I am a CS student (as many others here from what I can see haha) I have a bootcamp in some cybersecurity thing that i was granted via a scholarship.

I have experimented on linux many other times and toyed around with many concepts and am currently working on personal projects (setting different networks through virtualized environemnts) and  want to do many more to familiarize myself with different things I enjoy, mainly setting and developing environments/networks, creating tools to do certain tasks or setting tools for said tasks. 

I enjoy toying around with linux, I enjoy networks and different sublevels of knowledge domains of computers and systems as a whole, I like the concept of cloud and want to toy a lot more with it.

  
So from all of this I am just wondering what path would be better suited for me, cybersecurity engineering interests me but i am not attracted to being a SOC analyst at all, devops sounds good as well? and then system engineers/cloud engineers also attract me but I do not know which path would be better suited for me and what ways i could set myself for said path so I would be very thankful on any guidance.

COMMENT TEXT: I like the idea of doing Malware Analysis / Secure Software Development in the future. Combining Cybersecurity, Programming, possibly Machine Learning.  
  
Is this path overly ambitious/crazy?:  
IT Helpdesk / Internship -> SOC -> Software Development -> Pentesting -> Threat Hunting/DFIR -> Malware Analysis -> Exploit Development / Secure Software Development / Security Research (utilizing ML)?  
  
Background: MS in Cybersecurity, 2 years part-time Java Development, starting to forget programming, doing THM.

I know some would suggest skipping helpdesk in this case, but I like the idea of a more social role, improving softskills, helping people, and getting practical groundwork IT experience. I've just learned about Active Directory for example.  
At the same time, I would like to utilize programming in the future (preferably in C/Rust/Python/Haskell), perhaps even web development as a personal project.

I don't really want to skip anything. I don't mind lower pay, working odd hours early in the career, etc. I know priorities can change and I can figure stuff out as I go.

So my question really is, is it a good idea to look at Helpdesk or Internship jobs first or should I start with something else? Is anything less essential? Is it too drawn-out, risking burnout before I get anywhere near MA?

COMMENT TEXT: Hello all,

I'm a licensed mechanical engineer with some experience in the IT field as a system administrator. When I began working in the IT capacity, I designed and modernized our new controls system on secured network system as well as maintaining large database and infrastructure on our local networks. Eventually I ended up lead a team of Data Scientists and Software developers to develop one of the first in its kind optimization application. This was about 2-3 years ago. 

After working solely as a mechanical engineer during this time, I am getting the itch to get back into the IT field as I really enjoyed it back then. I would lose track of time and before I know it 8 hours had gone by. I want to focus more on cyber security but work life balance is a big thing for me. I'm taking certificate courses like Google Cyber Security and going to attempt to get my Sec+ certification as well.

I'm looking for someone whos been in the field to help me imagine what it is really like working in cyber security. Reading articles and job descriptions doesn't tell me what day-to-day experiences are and how that could potentially impact my life with my 2 kids who are still toddlers. I'm not sure where to even head into in cyber security as well as it is such a big field to navigate in and there is no one correct choice either. Sometimes I feel like I'm just jumping into the deep end of the pool and trying to stay afloat.

COMMENT TEXT: I didn't get an internship - what should I do now?

To give a brief overview, I'm a junior in college majoring in Cybersecurity and minoring in Criminal Justice and Computer Science with a 3.6 GPA. I know my resume isn't great - I have no experience in the field. I worked at Best Buy for a year and am currently working at Giant Eagle since last year. I recently switched over to Cyber as it is a very new program in my university. Before that, I was a Computer Science major. I applied for both cyber and help desk internships, and have gotten all denials with the same copy/paste reason - my experience isn't tailored to what they're looking for. I could give up, but I want to see what I can do from here. I know it is likely too late to get an internship now, but what should I do now to improve my chances in the future? Certifications are something I can do, but I don't want to shell out the money just for them to mean nothing. I want to know what the best path forward from here is.

COMMENT TEXT: I am currently a mid level Software Engineer with 7 YOE. I graduated in Computer Science from a UC. I love using code to solve problems, but this career path leaves me wanting something more. I want a career thats more interdisciplinary, use my programming skills, but to do more than just build user microservices and applications. I'd also like a career path that isn't dev tech lead/software manager. I'm interested in Cybersecurity, I think - or maybe what I \*think\* it is. I enjoy the idea of "defensive" coding, learning and defending against cyber threat tactics, especially with the use of AI. High level concepts more than programming paradigms. Plus, it was one of my favorite courses in undergrad.

I'm not opposed to going back to school or getting a certification for this specifically. In fact I think I'd enjoy going deeper into security topics again. 

  
Is this a viable idea for a career swap? What kind of "titles" do these jobs have? Would school be beneficial or a waste?

COMMENT TEXT: Hey everyone,

I’m considering making a career change into cybersecurity or GRC, but I have a lot of questions and would love to hear from people who are in the field. Here’s a bit about me:

* I'm a woman with a finance degree and about 6 years of work experience in that area, but It was too stressful. Learned a lot (managing clients/account management) but don't want this level of urgency/liability/stress anymore.
* I’m interested in **cybersecurity or GRC roles** because of the job demand and potential for higher salaries.
* I want to know what the **real day-to-day is like**. Is it tolerable, or is it mostly paperwork and high stress?
* I'm not interested in starting in help desk or entry-level tech roles; I’d prefer something more aligned with my background, like **risk management, compliance, or cybersecurity governance.**
* I’m looking into certifications (like **CISSP, CompTIA Security+, CISA,** etc.)—are they actually worth it? Do they **guarantee** **a job**, or is it still competitive to land a role even with certs? (I don't want to waste time if they're not necessary - which do you recommend?)
* How **stressful** is the work? I’d like a challenge but don’t want to burn out.
* What about **remote work**? Is it common in these fields?
* Also, what’s the **realistic starting salary** for someone transitioning into cybersecurity or GRC, and how much growth can I expect as I gain experience?
* Lastly, are there **other fields** that might be more worth pursuing, considering my background and goals, that offer better work-life balance, salary potential, or growth?

I’d really appreciate hearing about real-world experiences, especially if you transitioned from another field or have a background similar to mine.

Thanks in advance!

Ever since i was a kid i have always dreamt of being a cyber security engineer / ethical hacker, but things havent been going good lately. Since i started middle school i noticed that i dont quite understand what am learning i took not studying at the as the excuse for why 3 years later and i got into junior high, and now i started studying and trying to understand began to notice that am not as bright as my classmates and i got diagnosed with ADHD the same year which explained alot. 
 
I still clung to the hope that one day i will reach my dreams started taking a Python course at Udemy with Dr Angela Yu but i never finished the course cuase i would spend hours infront of medium and advanced level code projects not knowing what to even do.

I again still clung to hope, but now, approaching the end of senior high school i discovered that am stupid. I do not even compare with my average classmates no matter how hard i study i do not get good grades i do not quite understand the lesson completely.

So i am asking this... Am i fit to be a cybersecurity engineer ? Is it worth the hustle running after an unachievable dream? I began to give up..

COMMENT TEXT: 
Hi all,

I have some general newbie questions that others who are still new to the field might also want to know.

How to determine what hardware and software is private and secure?
i). Are there any cybersecurity websites report on hardware and software tests undertaken, the methods and analysis used for those tests, and their findings of their test results, do they state what their findings represent (if there exists cybersecurity/privacy weaknesses and what adverse occurances/risks those weaknesses could represent)?

ie. it's all well and good to state a software is "open source", but unless those with the necessary knowledge have analysed, assessed, stated the weaknesses and risks along with any limitations of their analysis (scope), "open source" is analogous to a kindergartner being seeing a calculus equation (sure, they can see the equation, but are completely inept at being able to solve it, let alone understand what a correct result represents).

If such cybersecurity websites and/or forums do exist, do they have other cybersecurity analysts comment (weigh-in and provide insight) on the cybersecurity testing results and what those results represent (akin to peer-review) to validate said findings and potentially highlight any errors, limitations not listed, or corrections that need to be incorporated (thus ensuring the results are relevant and valid to ensure the integrity of said findings)?

ie. stating,

which tests were run on the hardware or software,
what the respective test methods are testing for,
and what the tests found,
all of which allowing test and result replication along with comparative result analysis (the raw data and data result validation capability), testing of the methodology assessment (test parameter adequacy analysis so that what is supposedly being tested for is accurate), what weakness exists in the testing methodologies used (what had potentially been missed or possibly slipped through the testing process), and what the findings mean concisely/summerised form (similar to that used in engineering and science reports).

ii). If 1.i does not exist or is unavailable to the general public, what reputable sites and forums disseminate unbiased and reliable cybersecurity and privacy findings of cyber products (opposed to fear-mongering clickbait with generalised statements)?

iii). Does country of origin (manufacture or ownership) dictate trust scores or indicative trust confidence values related to cybersecurity hardware and software?

2. What websites/forums do those whom are cybersecurity experts (those of whom whos job it is to know and are heavily relied upon to give their expertise on cybersecurity software and/or hardware) use to stay currently informed on cyber risks?

3. Are there cybersecurity community/group collectives that only rely upon donations and genuine cybersecurity interests (Not for Profits with zero-ties to advertising or cyber business) for software and/or hardware that has no vested interests in having a bias towards those that fund them (integrity above monetary gain), if so what are they?

COMMENT TEXT: Hello, my name is mohammed ibrahim am a 17 years senior high school student living in Egypt.

Ever since i was a kid i have always dreamt of being a cyber security engineer / ethical hacker, but things havent been going good lately. Since i started middle school i noticed that i dont quite understand what am learning i took not studying at the time as the excuse for why. 3 years later i got into junior high, and started studying and trying to understand began to notice that am not as bright as my classmates. I got diagnosed with ADHD the same year which explained alot. 
 
I still clung to the hope that one day i will reach my dreams started taking a Python course at Udemy with Dr Angela Yu but i never finished the course cuase i would spend hours infront of medium and advanced level code projects not knowing what to even do.

I again still clung to hope, but now, approaching the end of senior high school i discovered that am stupid. I do not even compare with my average classmates no matter how hard i study i do not get good grades i do not quite understand the lesson completely.

So i am asking this... Am i fit to be a cybersecurity engineer ? Is it worth the hustle running after an unachievable dream? I began to give up..

COMMENT TEXT: Hello world. (Ive edited some parts because last post had too much cursing, Im sorry to that one mod who had to read it. Wasnt in the right headspace :( )

I would like to know what you guys would do in this position. So, I was given a note stated that I'll be kicked out from my uni for failing to pay. I only have 10K left in my bank acc and I don't think I can continue studying hahaha. But I did stumble upon certs that I could get. I dont know in Malaysia they would allow such thing but I heard that outside like america and such, allowed it.

**But is it an idiot option if I stop my degree (Well i have to lmao), and pursue for certs?**

It was my dream to get into cybersec because I like to protect. Thats all I wanted in life. To protect. And i find Cybersecurity to be my magnum opus when it comes to finding the best job. Now that dream's gone lmao. and I'm willing to spend every dollar of that 10K to get back to that dream of mine.

ps: The reason why I went to get my CS degree was only because my parents had the money at that time. I dont even want to explain what had happen to that money during my degree, but the money = poof.

I decided that I want to try my hand at the cybersecurity field mainly because I have always had a fascination with computers. I also would like to make a career out of it while also garnering a lot of money for my future. So my question is to all the people who have gone through the courses, classes, and what not how should I start. What websites should I be looking at? Is it better to be self- taught? I would greatly appreciate it. If y’all are wondering I have been self teaching myself about Linux which brought me here today to ask this question.

1. I created my own social engineering toolkit for my capstone project, as well as to put onto my resume. I built it from scratch and also included a UI for easier use. I programmed it so that I could put it onto a USB, run it as an executable rather than installing anything, and it can also run on windows. What could I do to take this project to the next step in order to impress any possible future employers?



2. What are the best ways to showcase my skills in a resume/interview?



3. Where do you see this industry going in the next 5-10 years?



4. What are hiring managers/recruiters looking for in entry level candidates?



5. Are there any mistakes you made or anything you wish that you had known sooner/before entering this industry?



Thank you for anyone who reads this post or responds I appreciate having a moment of your time! 

  
Certs Obtained: CCNA, Security +, AWS Cloud practitioner

Are there any other certs I should look into getting? Currently working on my PenTest+

The main tasking involves Sentinel/ Defender so I have been trying to get more familiar with KQL so I can be better/ more efficient with KQL queries since this is the tool that I spend the most time on and think I'm slowly getting better. I looked into the Microsoft SC-200 for a more in depth understanding of the tool but due to the Microsoft training being poor to navigate and the training not seeming to relate much to what I do I dropped it for general KQL learning which seemed to be more useful.

  
Due to this I was planning on working towards the Comptia CySA as I  already have the Security+ and A+ (will be looking in the Network at some point as well). Would you reccomend this path or are there better quals to do instead or after this? 

Thanks

COMMENT TEXT: Hello! I'm currently an undergraduate student and I've been interning as a cybersecurity engineer for around a year and a half now. While I love the work that I do and the hands-on approach that I have when it comes to engineering, my ultimate goal is to work in the field of public policy, and influence legislation and law, or serve in some sort of consulting/advising capacity in government. 

I think that having a solid foundation in cybersecurity (especially engineering) now can really lend itself to opening opportunities in the policy/legislation field, and I was wondering if anyone has any tips on how I can map out my career timeline best, to ultimately achieve that end goal. Are there any good internship programs for students who want to influence cybersecurity policy? Or maybe degree programs at a university that emphasize this? My foreseeable goal is getting a master's degree in cybersecurity engineering, though I'm uncertain if that's the right step, or if I should wait to gain more experience and apply to programs that cater to policy at large.

Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated!

COMMENT TEXT: The 3 most important things to get a job in cybersecurity are:

1. Work experience
2. Education
3. Certs

Sounds like you are taking some online courses, those can be good, but I also want you to recognize reality. If it's a course anyone can do in a short time, why would it get you a job, right? You will be competing for jobs with people with 4 years experience, a degree, AND certs.

Your best path is to try and get the most important piece ASAP. Work experience! Cybersecurity is just a branch of IT. Go find an IT job. It can literally be anything, just start *something*. If help desk is all you can do, do it.

While working, I do encourage you to at least consider college. You say you don't want to take years out of your life, but I hate to break it to you, that's life. You're 26 lol. You have literally 40 years of your career left. You (and I, I am 28) can't even comprehend that amount of time. So yeah, it's going to take 3-5 years to get in the industry. That's fine.

Certs are complements to a career, NOT a replacement to experience and education. While you are doing all this and want to grind, sure, get your Security+, Network+, etc. But recognize you can't just get a couple and expect a job.

Hope this helps, let me know if you have other questions. I just want you to know that you are incredibly young and have plenty of time. You can do this!

COMMENT TEXT: > I feel so alienated going to school with people who have grown up building computers and have extensive experience with tinkering with computers and I feel light years behind the ball.

This is an incredibly common and relatable feeling. The good news? You are not nearly as far behind as you think!

At the end of the day, the cyber and IT industry is about *being good at boring*. Knowing networking fundamentals, having experience doing sysadmin work, and most of all, knowing how to work with people and write documentation are so, so much more important than building computers.*

While it isn't a competition, I think it's healthy to realize these people in your school will be competing for the same jobs as you. So how do you "beat" them? You work harder. You study the boring things. You know what a networking packet looks like inside and out.  You mess around with Linux on your own time and become a command line ninja. (when I was in school I got really into Linux, which led to a linux sysadmin job, which led to a better sysadmin job, which led to a 6 figure cyber job..... purely anecdotal but shows how a passion started in school can lead to good things).

Now is a time to mess around with a ton of technologies and find out what *you* are into. The more "boring" it seems to the majority... the better for you. If your passion is pen testing, go for it, but realize that half the people you're studying with think they want to be pen testers because it sounds exciting.

I always invite people to put linux on a laptop and just do all their work from it if possible. You learn so much just using it day to day, and there is a high likelihood you will work with linux systems in your career.

*Tangent on building computers: I recognize this is a major hobby for many cybersecurity professionals, but I personally have never been interested in it. Been working in some IT/cyber job for over 5 years and consider myself good at my job, have a senior title, etc, and never built a computer. It really doesn't matter for most jobs. 

THAT BEING SAID, if building computers is interesting, do it. You'll make more friends in your major and future coworkers. That alone is HUGE. One of my jobs is literally from replacing a last minute dropout a friend from my major had in a contractor position.

Hope this helps, sorry if overly verbose.

COMMENT TEXT: YYeah, that’s pretty much how it works at a basic level.

COMMENT TEXT: I would extend your metaphor to account for digital signatures as well.

How would we know - for example - that something sent actually comes from you (vs. someone pretending to be you)? In this example, you'd encrypt (sign) with your private key - then everyone with your public key is able to verify the thing came from you. This is why it's important to describe both private/public parts of asymmetric encryption as keys.

The metaphor in this case is kind of like the Cinderella story, if everyone - including the prince - had the glass slipper (public key). When all the step sisters (malicious actors) come forward claiming to be Cinderella (you), we can trivially check if that's the case by seeing if our copy of the glass slipper fits (since it should only fit Cinderella).

A bit of a round-about way of thinking, but important to include in your understanding of asymmetric keys.

COMMENT TEXT: The best way: Attend a quality university (local is fine). Get a computer science, IT management, or similar fundamentals degree. Work in IT or software development where entry level jobs are plentiful. Keep an eye out for security related projects. Build a professional network of cybersecurity professionals (easier than ever before). Find out what it takes to bring valuable skills to the table in your particular area, work to obtain those specific items. Transition into cybersecurity. Later in your career, pick up that MBA and move toward management or senior roles.

The hard way: Be exceptionally skilled, passionate, and hard working. Teach yourself.

The absolute worst way: Get a bunch of meaningless certificates from expensive "bootcamp" programs with no other education or experience.

Stop looking at learning technologies as things to check off. They just don’t work like that. Tools are used to complete objectives.

Becoming a penetration tester is a great goal. If you work hard enough, you can get there.

But remember that *you’re a first year university student*. There is a long time to go before your dream job! Don’t stress so much about it. Work on:

1. Doing well in school.
2. Getting work experience. While you should go for cybersecurity internships for sure, you should also be working in IT. Working as a system admin got me into pen testing eventually. After all, how do you expect to break in and create reports on systems you don’t understand?
3. Pursue your passions! Being passionate and diving deep on something (assuming you have 1 and 2 covered) will help a lot.

Hope that helps. Happy to answer other questions.

If you don't have a degree, most folks that make it generally lean on some subset of:

* Military service
* An extended cyber-adjacent career (i.e. IT, webdev, etc.), later specializing
* Opportunities within their present employer to adopt/own more security-centric tasks.
* Professional network hook-ups, nepotism, etc.

Develop your professional network, your peers and professors may end up being lifelong professional contacts. Knowing someone at a company that can give you a referral will always give you a leg up.

Advancement and profession development is company dependent. My company tries to hire internally and provides a lot of growth within the team, such as hiring help desk techs to our SOC or sysadmins as security engineers. There are also multiple tracks for advancement for each role. We have Admins and Specialists that are the junior roles. Mid-level and beyond there are Analysts I-IV; Engineers I-III, Senior, Principal; Architect, Senior, Principal. Leadership side, there are Lead Analysts and Engineers, Managers, Senior Managers, Directors/AVPs, Deputy CISOs/VPs, CISO/SVP.

Do you have a bachelor degree, even in an unrelated field? CISA is good but does have an experience requirement of 5 years in IT audit or infosec. Having a bachelor degree in any field will take 2 years off that. Security+ is a good place to start for an overview of the field. ITIL Foundations might be a good cert for you, it's more about IT processes but is sort of the backbone of IT auditing. Might be a good bridging cert until you can get CISA.

COMMENT TEXT: It's usually recommended to go with a broader technology degree, such as Computer Science, Information Technology, or Information Systems. Computer Science is generally considered to be the strongest degree because of it's theoretical content. It also provides the most career paths like SDE/SWE, data science, and IT & cyber.

Information Technology and Information Systems degrees are good options too. The content is still broad to provide multiple career paths, sysadmin, SRE, networking, database, cyber. The downside is that there is little theory, instead focusing on operational content that can quickly be out of date.

The problem with Cyber degrees is that many are just cash grabs with terrible curriculums. They might focus on "flashy" but largely irrelevant topics like pentesting without building any fundamentals. A good Cyber degree should be at least half a CS or IT degree before even getting into security topics. It also might limit your career options to just security and security-adjacent roles.

It's challenging for us to be prescriptive when...

* We can't see your resume, which is how you present yourself to employers (vs. your comment, which is how you present yourself to us).
* We don't know what your job hunting looks like more granularly. See related: https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/184p0vk/comment/kb0qji6/

> Is there a certification that’s on the cheaper side (less than 200$?) that could potentially bolster my resume?

Probably not. If you're trying to promote your employability (vs. upskilling), what you want to be doing is determining [which certifications are the most oft-requested](https://bytebreach.com/posts/what-certifications-should-you-get/) and prioritize those. Unfortunately, they usually are priced in the hundreds (if not thousands) of USD.

> One last thing to add - from what I’ve seen on here, cyber isn’t really an entry level field to get into, and I’m best off applying to IT and entry level help desk positions, which I have really focused on the past couple months and still really had no luck.

Concur with nuance: having a relevant work history [carries more weight with employers than anything else](https://bytebreach.com/assets/images/isaca_survey.PNG), which lends to the majority of employed cybersecurity professionals being more experienced.

Candidly, when you're as early in your cybersecurity career as you are, you can't really afford to be picky; you should look to take *any* form of cybersecurity employment. It's much easier to shape your career towards how you want to to be once you're already working (vs. trying to force your way into the role you desire from the outside looking in). That may involve the SOC, it may not; I never worked in the SOC (my first cybersecurity role was as a GRC functionary), but I didn't really have any weight to my employability until I was already working 3 years or so. That time allowed me to more readily shape how I did (and did not) want my career to look like, answering similar questions as yours.

COMMENT TEXT: Hi there!

> Is this path overly ambitious/crazy?:
>
> IT Helpdesk / Internship -> SOC -> Software Development -> Pentesting -> Threat Hunting/DFIR -> Malware Analysis -> Exploit Development / Secure Software Development / Security Research (utilizing ML)?

Here's the points of friction I might anticipate:

* SWE/dev roles look for different indicators of your employability than what most cybersecurity roles might (and vis versa). The kinds of experiences you want to highlight will be different, the types of projects you showcase will be different, and how you prepare to interview will likely be divergent. If you want to be employed as a SWE, you're probably hurting your chances by trying to work in a SOC.
* While it's not uncommon to pivot laterally between lines of work in cybersecurity - especially because it's easier to do so once you're already working in cybersecurity at all - each time you do so you're doing a soft reboot of your career; breadth in your career is nice, but depth is what will make you more employable as a 3+ year staffer looking to either promote or make more money, otherwise you risk interviewing for more junior roles relative to your cumulative YoE each time you transition between lines of work.

> At the same time, I would like to utilize programming in the future (preferably in C/Rust/Python/Haskell), perhaps even web development as a personal project.

Speaking in *very* broad strokes, most dev work in the cybersecurity space is more-or-less the same as dev work anywhere else, it's just that the product is functionally different. So if you want to be a dev, I'd encourage you to focus on promoting your employability in the dev space with the (eventual) goal of targeting employers that offer such products/services.

A lot of cybersecurity work (most - I'd contend) is about protecting *someone else's* stuff (be it code, networks, data, etc.) vs. generating original work. Most of the original authored work I've seen have been in the spaces of personal projects (which might extend to published security research), smaller-scoped R&D, and/or academia.

> So my question really is, is it a good idea to look at Helpdesk or Internship jobs first or should I start with something else? Is anything less essential? Is it too drawn-out, risking burnout before I get anywhere near MA?

It's not altogether inappropriate, but I think - without looking at your resume - you might want to consider instead aiming for either the SWE roles or (alternatively) see if you have any luck in the AppSec/DevSec spaces.

I made the pivot into cybersecurity from an unrelated military career pre-kids; I now have young children.

The early-career experience is likely not going to be representative of your long-term WLB, likely being more demanding of your time and offering less flexibility than when you become more senior. The *biggest* differentiator when it comes to being available for family (for me) is whether or not the role is remote or not; remote work has made me *way* more present in my kids' lives than an in-office job ever could have afforded.

> These are the units offered by my university for two separate degrees. Which of the two options is best to become a cybersecurity professional?

Respectfully, you're probably not going to find someone to audit your options on your behalf. [That's a lot of work](http://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/1fn7dbl/mentorship_monday_-_post_all_career_education_and_job_questions_here/lp9bnpz?context=3) and should extend well beyond just the names of the courses you might take.

There's a lot of context we lack from what you've provided. A non-exhaustive list:

* Would you be taking all of these classes or only some of them? If only some, which?
* Since there's so much overlap between the plans, have you mapped out which courses are unique to each plan?
* Of the classes you intend to take, have you pulled past syllabi, looked into the staff instructors teaching those classes, and the reviews from your peers? Where are the pain points? Where are the ones that you'd expect the most growth from?
* Having done the above, which courses within each respective plan would you miss out on by choosing the opposing plan?
* Why are there a dissimilar number of classes between the plans?
* Would you be taking the courses in the order that they are presented? Does that matter?

So on and so forth. 

Most importantly, we don't know what *you* value in your education - you haven't indicated to us one way or the other which option you like more (or more importantly, why). So it's that much harder to prescribe which we might think is more appropriate.

Best of luck!

You definitely don't give up; not looking for work certainly makes it less likely that you'll find employment (ever).

Besides [the job hunting guidance I prescribe more generally](https://old.reddit.com/r/u_fabledparable/comments/17xlmrc/cybersecurity_mentorship_references/k9ogpq3/), I'd encourage you to look at your university's opportunities for work study (e.g. with the IT dept. at your school to help offset tuition). I'd also encourage you to look at localized part-time employment opportunities that may either build on what you have or diversify your skillset (I'm unfamiliar with what your responsibilities look like at Giant Eagle, but I'll assume they are at best cyber-adjacent).

Cultivating that work history is *THE* objective, offset only by not dropping out of school. Everything else is secondary or on an as-able basis.

> Hi, I am looking into online masters programs for cybersecurity and it would be great to get some advice.

Just to give you an additional option, I got my MS in CompSci from Georgia Tech:

https://omscs.gatech.edu/

They have a parallel program for Cybersecurity (which has a lot of the same overlapping coursework available to enroll in):

https://pe.gatech.edu/degrees/cybersecurity

Both programs are likewise asynchronous, which I saw you valued. The former also caps off at about $10k total for the degree (more or less), significantly cheaper than the other offerings you were weighing.

If it's worth anything for you as a datapoint: I finished my MS in CompSci in just over 3 years, taking 1 course each semester (Fall, Spring, Summer) taking no breaks while working fulltime, having 2 kids, and a pandemic. I wrote more about the experience here: https://bytebreach.com/posts/omscs_writeup/ Some people double up on classes to accelerate their timetable, but I wasn't in a hurry.

> I obtained a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering, and found myself a Cybersecurity Engineering role out of college. I love what I am doing and plan to stay in the field. I have <1 year of experience, and am looking into masters programs to begin in the Fall term.

Just as a note: your work history in this space will do far more for your employability. Since you already attained a job in the space (one of the hardest steps for many in their early career), just make sure you don't do anything to jeopardize that.

I was in a similar position as you at one time (I got my first job in Cybersecurity with a BA in Political Science) and I found - ultimately - I felt like I needed my Masters degree a whole lot *less* as my career matured; by the time I graduated I found more value in the degree's academic exploration of subjects matter I was unlikely to encounter in the scope of my work (vs. making me feel more qualified/employable).

Food for thought.

> My main question is, does it matter where the masters degree is from? Do employers or a company's upper management care about the credibility of schools in the cybersecurity world?

In cold-submitting applications, no. Whether or not you have a degree at all (and if said degree is in a related area of study) matters more in such cases.

Where it *does* matter is in what opportunities your given institution is able to afford you while you're there. This includes things like:

* Better staff involved in research that you can participate in
* More grant money to fund more interesting/modernized curricula
* Larger/more competitive employers to your institution's career fairs for students/graduates.
* A (potentially) greater likelihood in networking with peers who will achieve outcomes you can engage to help your own professional trajectory.

Smaller, less established school tend to attract less prominent faculty, fewer research opportunities, and smaller/fewer employers to their career fairs; their alumni also are more variable in their outcomes, making the professional peer network likewise more nebulous in its value.

> ...want to learn and be able to finish as quick as possible.

As a third-party in your academic considerations, these goals are not necessarily in harmony with each other. Which are you prioritizing?

> Is that extra time spent obtaining a masters at a more credible / widely known school worth it in the cybersecurity world? Or does it not matter where the degree is from, just that you have it.

Again, depends on what you do with your time there. If you're just there for the degree - to pass classes and get paper - I'd argue there's a case to be made that it isn't worth the extra time/money.

> I’m considering making a career change into cybersecurity or GRC...

Small point-of-order: I'd consider GRC to be a subdomain of cybersecurity employment, among [many other roles that collectively contribute to the space](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/smbnzt/mentorship_monday/hw8mw4k/).

> I want to know what the real day-to-day is like. Is it tolerable, or is it mostly paperwork and high stress?

I worked at one time as a GRC functionary for a DoD contractor pre-current presidential administration. That was my first cybersecurity job in pivoting from an unrelated military career.

I found the work at that time to be among the most stable and predictable among all of the jobs I've held within cybersecurity. There's a lot of administrative tasks that are involved (i.e. paperwork), but there can be - at times - pressure for you to perform; federal systems are not authorized to operate without observing/participating in GRC, which can *really* irritate stakeholders who would observe your job as being obstructionist.

In the present day, I won't pretend to know whether or not GRC functionaries that work for the U.S. federal gov't would still say that their work feels stable/predictable; but this is probably owed to the administration's behavior and less to their capacity as being GRC.

For more details, you might consult these resources which include 1-on-1 interviews with people from all across the domain, including GRC: https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/comments/sb7ugv/mentorship_monday/hux2869/

> I’m looking into certifications (like CISSP, CompTIA Security+, CISA, etc.)—are they actually worth it? Do they guarantee a job, or is it still competitive to land a role even with certs?

Are they strictly necessary? No - at least not in the United States. Cybersecurity employment isn't licensed (unlike professionals in the medical and legal spaces, for example).

Generally speaking, people pursue certifications because:

* They want to upskill (and certifications usually have accompanying trainings which facilitate that).
* They want to improve their employability on-paper, improving the odds of a callback for an interview.

How competitive you'll appear to an employer [largely rests with how applicable your existing work history is](https://bytebreach.com/assets/images/isaca_survey.PNG) more than anything.

> How stressful is the work?

Variable by team and employer, less so by role-type. Employment contract can also contribute to this (e.g. maintaining billable hours as a contractor).

> What about remote work? Is it common in these fields?

In the case of working for the DoD, rarely - I never saw it. Working with classified information implicitly means you can't work from home.

More broadly? Sure, there's opportunities. However, you may not be able to net one in your first cybersecurity role.

> Also, what’s the realistic starting salary for someone transitioning into cybersecurity or GRC, and how much growth can I expect as I gain experience?

There's wildly differentiating numbers here. Broadly speaking, your compensation is tightly coupled to your seniority, your geography, and your employer more than anything else. See related: https://old.reddit.com/r/u_fabledparable/comments/17xlmrc/cybersecurity_mentorship_references/k9oyxg5/

Generally speaking, compensation averages are well north of the national median.

> Lastly, are there other fields that might be more worth pursuing, considering my background and goals, that offer better work-life balance, salary potential, or growth?

I wouldn't know; I haven't looked into them.

> How long would each cert take to get?

Wildly variable based on your familiarity with the subject matter, your comfort with the exam format, and your availability to study. However, I'd speculate *on average* an arbitrary certification might take 3-6 months of dedicated study, though - again - there's a lot of room for variance here.

> Should I instead do something else with my time like projects?

I'd approach certifications on an "as-able" basis, supplementing your other employability efforts. Your primary effort should be in cultivating a pertinent work history (likely in cyber-adjacent roles, though potentially direct in internships). If after that and your studies you have bandwidth (and funds) for a certification, go for it.

COMMENT TEXT: Hi there!

Lot's of great questions.

> How to determine what hardware and software is private and secure?

Strangely, that's tough to answer.

I'd encourage you not to think of privacy/security in absolute terms, but instead as a kind of gradient along acceptable risk. Because of the sheer sprawl, rate of innovation, and emergent vulnerabilities in tech, it's generally not tenable to ascribe anything as being absolutely private/secure unless you were to render it unusable.

To that end, enterprise/regulated software and systems are generally ascribed a grade based on standardized frameworks (e.g. ISO 27001, RMF, etc.). These kinds of frameworks effectively assures due care and due diligence is performed by the owners/custodians of these software/systems to mitigate risk as best as possible.

The overwhelming majority of software isn't so professionalized, however - and the majority of the public has never heard of (or is even aware of) such standards. Instead, most end-user consumers operate on word-of-mouth, third parties, or (lately) whatever an LLM tells them. More mature organizations might have their own supply chain management process in place to vet what kinds of software they admit into their networks/systems for professional use (and some enterprises - like Google - prefer in some cases to write their own to mitigate the risk of introducing outside malicious code dependencies); however, even then so-called trusted software or "known good" partners can fail (see the recent Okta and Crowdstrike compromises, for example).

> Are there any cybersecurity websites report on hardware and software tests undertaken, the methods and analysis used for those tests, and their findings of their test results, do they state what their findings represent (if there exists cybersecurity/privacy weaknesses and what adverse occurances/risks those weaknesses could represent)?

Yes and no.

There are some sites - like virustotal - which allows users to submit suspicious software/files for fingerprinting; this allows third-parties to identify trends in emergent malware, which virustotal pipes along to most modern AV solutions. End-users can also see if anyone else has submitted that software/file, which - in aggregate - may help ID whether it's safe.

But outside of malware, the secure testing of commercial and/or non-malicious software tends to be opaque. Most proprietary software owners aren't keen on disclosing their source code because they don't want to surrender their competitive business advantage; ergo, the public is generally limited in knowing the extent of security testing performed - it's usually not in the best interest of the software owner to be overly prescriptive about what they have (and have not) done, lest they provide insight to bad actors about where to look. At best, a curious individual could look up to see if there are any [CVEs](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/search_cve_list.html) reported for particular versions of their software, but this wouldn't detail the breadth of other tests that were performed.

The above also assumes that the software owner is open to third-party testing (vs. prosecuting such research as being criminal, or in the very least in breach of terms of service). There are instances where good Samaritans looking to disclose discovered vulnerabilities shy away from doing so due to the perceived individual risk they would incur. Ironically, such sentiment contributes to black market activity (i.e. instead selling knowledge of the vulnerability to someone who *would* do harm). This is why we should encourage organizations to develop bug bounty programs with safe harbor clauses in reporting security vulnerabilities.

Open-source software tends to be a little bit better, provided the community around said software is active and large. In principle, the idea of having so many eyes on said software elevates the opportunity for a good Samaritan to identify/fix exploitable bugs; "rising waters lifts all ships", so to speak. Using utilities like git allows everyone to observe changes to the software over time and understand why they're being implemented.

> If 1.i does not exist or is unavailable to the general public, what reputable sites and forums disseminate unbiased and reliable cybersecurity and privacy findings of cyber products (opposed to fear-mongering clickbait with generalized statements)?

As an end-user consumer? Outside of entrusting some vendors as "known good", you're probably looking at aggregating a collection of sources as corroborating any given software version as appropriately secure.

> Does country of origin (manufacture or ownership) dictate trust scores or indicative trust confidence values related to cybersecurity hardware and software?

Sometimes, but not always.

As a U.S. resident, if I know that some software was produced/made/released out of North Korea, I almost assuredly wouldn't trust it, for example - even if it was centrally managed by an authoritative body from within North Korea. The inverse of this national bias isn't true too: I don't implicitly trust all software made within the U.S. (but I don't have an immediate knee-jerk response to its national authorship in the way I do with North Korea). At the end-user consumer level, different people will have different feelings about national authorship, and that's assuming they are even aware of it. Case-in-point: TikTok and DeepSeek.

For organizations the story is a little different, because they tend to be beholden to laws, standards, and regulations about what they can and cannot do. ITAR - for example - is one such compliance measure that businesses in the U.S. have to observe in where they can export their software to. There's also various embargos that have been placed on various nation-state's overtime further limiting where software can be (officially) imported from.

But all of the above speaks to commercial software; it's often tricky - especially in cases where the software is open-source - to truly attribute where the code is authored.

> What websites/forums do those whom are cybersecurity experts (those of whom whos job it is to know and are heavily relied upon to give their expertise on cybersecurity software and/or hardware) use to stay currently informed on cyber risks?

I don't have any *singular* source; I have a managed RSS feed from a range of different sources. Honestly though - since my work isn't involved in Intel - the rate of new developments tends to outpace my awareness of most matters except those that directly impact me and my work.

> Are there cybersecurity community/group collectives that only rely upon donations and genuine cybersecurity interests (Not for Profits with zero-ties to advertising or cyber business) for software and/or hardware that has no vested interests in having a bias towards those that fund them (integrity above monetary gain), if so what are they?

I didn't understand this question as written.

More obliquely, there's all kinds of groups that have mission statements of looking to help secure consumer privacy, data, systems, etc. - with varying degrees of effectiveness and scope. I defer you to your choice of search engine first, however.

COMMENT TEXT: A large portion of the security community will never have to code anything in assembly in a professional sense. I am one of those people. That being said, it's important to understand the basis of machine code just to know how things operate. The people who *really* use assembly are reverse engineers or programmers working on low-level architecture. There is also a niche for individuals who do code reviews and optimizations. 

Assembly helps a lot, too, in CTFs and other gamified learning platforms, but not to a massive extent.

COMMENT TEXT: > How do people understand assembly language(we're using nasm, Ghidra for assembing and disassembling) and actually use it at work?? Is my current reverse engineering course one of those just take and never user classes?

For context, Assembly used to be *THE* programming language programmers learned (i.e. circa 1980s or so). Famously, the "Roller Coaster Tycoon" video game was programmed entirely using the language (a feat that seems unimaginable today). Higher-level programming languages have helped abstract away such low-level instructions and made coding more accessible to a broader talent base. EDIT: importantly, compiled binaries can still be disassembled from machine code back into their assembly instructions, hence why it's still pertinent as a language to learn.

If your work requires you to use it, then you learn/adopt it. Arguably, most roles in the professional space don't require you to engage code at that low-level. Those that do - however - *really* need you to understand what's happening (e.g. reverse engineers, malware analysts, etc.).

More to-your-question, however: like anything else, you get better at it through repeated/consistent exposure and engagement. I remember when I first saw x86 Assembly how intimidating it looked, but now it's not so bad.

> I got diagnosed with ADHD the same year which explained alot....I again still clung to hope, but now, approaching the end of senior high school i discovered that am stupid. I do not even compare with my average classmates no matter how hard i study i do not get good grades i do not quite understand the lesson completely.

There's some stuff to unpack here:

* First, you need therapy (or at least a figure in your life to affirm that you are worthy). You are not stupid, and ADHD is not a career death sentence. You're being extraordinarily hard on yourself unnecessarily.
* You're young and - if I may say so - hormonal. This lends itself to massive mood swings during our teenage years; I know it may feel like I'm patronizing you here, but I'm trying to suggest that - perhaps - your situation only *feels* as dire as you're making it out to be. Your frame of reference is confined to your limited experience/impression to the professional world (and therefore what seems like a big deal really isn't - or at least, not in terms of your lifelong career trajectory).
* Formal academia - particularly when working through your formative years with a disability - may not gel with how you best learn/ingest what's of interest to you. Candidly, you're probably going to have to take some indeterminate amount of time learning *how to learn*. It may - or may not - involve medication, certain environment(s)/condition(s), trying out different times for engagement, etc. The point here is that sitting and listening to lectures (recorded or otherwise) may not be the way you learn best, so you might want to try experimenting with ways that *do* resonate with you.
* Udemy (or any other MOOC) isn't an industry standard for measuring employability. People opt out of finishing those kinds of courses *all the time*. They're supplemental and low-stakes.

Cut yourself some slack.

Polish up the product, try and make it spread (either as an open source tool or a side-hustle income). It's a project, so if you want to make it more noteworthy, then it has to become more worthy of note.

Other avenues include expanding its applied research in academia (i.e. published in peer-reviewed journals or conference presentations).

In the U.S.? Likely responding to upsets introduced by the federal government under the current administration. Huge upheavals in the GRC space and vulnerabilities that result as a consequence of systemic de-regulation.

Globally? More AI panic. Implementation friction points concerning quantum-resistant cryptography algorithms at-scale. A decrease in reported memory-faults relative to other vulnerability types. Otherwise, more of the same more generally.

As a gentle form of constructive criticism, you may want to consider working on your ability to communicate effectively; cybersecurity work is tightly coupled with being able to accurately and unambiguously relay information to stakeholders, be it in the form of testing reports, security research, vulnerability analysis, etc.

COMMENT TEXT: I have the A+ and Security + certs. That and a military background helped. Alot of applications and a few interviews combined with a bit of luck I suspect. Took me a good few months but managed in the end. Can't say how hard it was since I don't have much to compare it to really but just kept going ... didn't have much choice not to really.

COMMENT TEXT: I’m not sure. What job do you have? Might be better to level up at work and complement that work with some good certifications.

Masters degrees could also be a consideration. I wish I had better advice for that, but I only have my bachelors.

COMMENT TEXT: Ask me whatever on reddit, but I do keep this separated for my personal life.

>I looked into companies like Rapid7 ect and from what i can tell, they seem to be pretty open to hiring entry level people (thats assuming they're hiring in your area)

I am not saying it's impossible, I think that you should definitely apply for this type of stuff. Just realize that you're competing with other applicants with IT experience, you know? But you definitely wouldn't be the first to start in cyber without any prior experience.

What I don't want you to do is to turn down or not apply for IT jobs waiting for that unicorn. That's bad news and how people never get in.

COMMENT TEXT: Don’t worry bro, I’m not an interviewer. Can you give me a no-BS answer: what jobs have you actually been paid for? What does hands on experience in digital forensics mean but no IT experience? That seems like a contradiction.

COMMENT TEXT: I recommend doing what you need to do to pass your classes.

Outside of that, do what is interesting to you. Explore. You need to be curious and proactive yourself, nobody can hold your hand.

For me, Linux was really interesting during uni. So I played with that a lot.

>what language gave it?

No language does. That’s my point. For example, if you decide to learn French, the only way you know if you’re learning it well enough is speaking to others in France(or somewhere else that speaks French). There is no official measure on how good you are at French. Sure there are tests and certifications, like Python, but there is no universal checkbox.

COMMENT TEXT: You'd fall under entry-associate level experience with 2 years. Those levels are fairly swamped.

COMMENT TEXT: Meet cybersecurity people in your area. It is very important to get to know others. Look for DEFCON groups, BSides, DevOps, user groups, student groups, and so on. Anything that puts you shoulder-to-shoulder with people in the industry. Ask them what they are looking for when they hire. Ask what interview questions they like to use. Volunteer and get involved, and it is possible you may find a mentor (highly valuable). Offer to take them to a business lunch and learn all you can.

I don't have empirical data to link you to, but my personal impression/experience is "yes".

COMMENT TEXT: What valuable advice. Until now, I have been obsessed with knowledge and forgotten about people. Maybe the years and personal experiences have made me change.
I'm going to start getting involved in communities and people, also contributing things of value. Sometimes one asks for a lot but gives little.
You may find it funny but I'm going to have the conversation as my wallpaper so I don't forget it haha. That way it doesn't look like just another conversation.
