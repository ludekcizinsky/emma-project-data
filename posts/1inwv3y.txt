[NIST.gov](http://NIST.gov) has just dropped a new batch of vulnerabilities affecting several widely used WordPress plugins.

These vulnerabilities include SQL injection, stored cross-site scripting (XSS), arbitrary file uploads, privilege escalation, and more. If you or your clients are using any of these plugins, it’s time to take action—these issues range from medium to critical severity and could lead to data breaches, account takeovers, or even full server compromise.

# Highlights of the Latest Vulnerabilities:

# What Should You Do?

1. **Check if you’re using any of the affected plugins.**
2. **Update immediately** if a patch is available.
3. If no patch is available, consider **disabling the plugin** and finding an alternative until the issue is resolved.
4. **Monitor your systems** for any signs of exploitation.

 If you’re managing WordPress sites for clients, make sure they’re aware of these risks.
