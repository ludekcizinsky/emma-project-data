POST ID: 1iq4k3r / POST TITLE: Applying in another country!
====================================================================================================
Good morning everyone!  I have 13 years of cybersecurity experience and as my son gets older I've thought about applying for work in other countries.  I'm Canadian, but not just the US.

Does anyone know of countries actively hiring growing cybersecurity contractors / employees?  If so what has been your experience.
