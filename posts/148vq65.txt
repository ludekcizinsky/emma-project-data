COMMENT TEXT: So you're using Kali Linux in WSL, try installing Kali Linux to a usb or onto the hard drive, that way it shouldn't have these problems.

Also try net.ipv4.ip_forward to 1 in /etc/sysctl.conf and reload it using the command sysctl -p

Either should work better and if the connection is HTTPS you'll need to install a certificate or downgrade the connection, real world scenario you'd have access to the victims machine and install your certificate that way they wouldn't see any errors.

COMMENT TEXT: In the terminal, if it ran once and it was fine then you may have changed something which broke it, have a look at previous commands or think back to things you've done in the past since it ran well.

It shouldn't just stop working.

COMMENT TEXT: Thank you . I've done nothing wrong but i feel like the linux or bettercap is not stable .while using net.show sometimes it shows all ip's connected on the network and sometimes shows nothing! .a restart needed to work good again and so on

COMMENT TEXT: It does that sometimes without really telling you what the issue is, but it's stable ettercap is EOL but I'd suggest checking /var/logs and under Kali and see if there's any issue there
