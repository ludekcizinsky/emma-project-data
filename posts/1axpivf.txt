COMMENT TEXT: If taking courses is an option, you could look into that. You could also look into certification pathways, like from CompTIA (Net+ > Sec+ > PenTest+/CySA+). You don‚Äôt have to get the certs, but they could help outline the order of the content you‚Äôll need to learn. With your background, you could look into application security. 

If you‚Äôre familiar with VM‚Äôs and Linux, VulnHub offers community-sourced VM‚Äôs that are designed to be exploitable, so you could create a NAT network VM in VirtualBox to practice. This would consist of at least your VM and the VulnHub VM on the network, so you can scan or exploit it however you want.

Get ready for the gatekeeping. A lot of cybersecurity ‚Äúprofessionals‚Äù that you‚Äôll find in these threads don‚Äôt take kindly to questions and insist that you need to have extensive Linux and network/system engineering experience before you can even think about security. While it would obviously help, this simply isn‚Äôt true. Just stay interested, do your research, try things, and learn.
