POST ID: 1iof55a / POST TITLE: Cyber Security changes with AI
====================================================================================================
Hello everyone! I am a year 13 student doing an EPQ about cyber security for college. I am really interested in the topic and would really appreciate having some discussions / interviews with people that are actually in the field of cybersecurity, specifically regarding how things have changed or will change with the widespread availability of AI. 

If anyone is able to share any information it would be really appreciated! If anyone would be willing to do an interview with me please either reply or dm, I am avilable whenever is convenient :)
