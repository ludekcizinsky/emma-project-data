POST ID: 1iraz2c / POST TITLE: A question about AI and the adaptation in the field? Is it comparable now to the way Google was 20 years ago?
====================================================================================================
I am entering the industry and I want to know what professionals who have been around in cyber have seen over the last 5 or so years.

I am interested in what has changed in your roles, and what those roles are. I would also really be interested to know what you have noticed in the behavior of threat actors and malicious software/hardware e.c.t.

I believe that while A.I will drive a change in the industry, it will not drive a change in the amount of human involvement needed to maintain systems, but it will change what the involvement is.

As we get access to tools and features for the best interests those same tools can be abused by others and I believe that just as much as google allowing faster access to information merely changed how we work, AI will be the same. But I could be wrong, I am not seasoned at this so I would like to know what you all think about that point of view.

Aswell as that, do you think that it is worth my time to master skills I can get AI to do, such as the deconstruction of code, networks and patterns. Or do I learn to hone a new approach to the profession using AI as in integral part of my toolset, much the same as Google has become an integral part of the industry today.

In your experience, has AI changed the field so much that I am better off learning how to use it and master it, arguably becoming skillful in a "new" way. Or do I learn how to navigate the field without needing to use it.

I don't want to seem as if I am asking "can I use AI, and not my brain". I really want to know what more experienced eyes have seen surrounding the adaptation of AI, and if I should save time moving past certain areas that I can use AI for, and instead focus on things that AI can not be used for. Or if that will hinder me in the long run.

I don't know if that makes sense or not, I am not the greatest at explaining myself but hopefully you all can understand what I am asking?
