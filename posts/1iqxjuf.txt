POST ID: 1iqxjuf / POST TITLE: Free Risk Register template for Information Security
====================================================================================================
Hi friends! I am back with a free resource - a comprehensive Risk Register template. 

I have tried to make this template unique by including features such as:

* A separate Task Tracker to track the work that you do to mitigate risks. Merged cells to track mitigations is something I always hated in risk registers.
* Gantt chart to demonstrate the timeline for risk mitigation. This is great if you are just starting off with your Risk Management program.
* Good Dashboards and metrics

You can download the template from this link: [https://allaboutgrc.com/risk-register-template-for-information-security/](https://allaboutgrc.com/risk-register-template-for-information-security/)

I have tried to include as much information about the template as possible in the post. But if there is something that needs further explanation, do let me know. 

Hope all you find this helpful and feel free to contact me if you have any feedback or suggestions.
