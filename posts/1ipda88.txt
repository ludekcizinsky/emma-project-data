POST ID: 1ipda88 / POST TITLE: Top cybersecurity stories for the week of 02-10-25 to 02-14-25
====================================================================================================
Host Rich Stroffolino will be chatting with our guest, **Doug Mayer, vp, CISO, WCG** about some of the biggest stories in cybersecurity this past week. You are invited to watch and participate in the live discussion. We go to air at 12:30pm PT/3:30pm ET. Just go to YouTube Live here [https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY](https://youtube.com/live/Zb2Oe9WaAKY) or you can [subscribe to the Cyber Security Headlines podcast](https://cisoseries.com/subscribe-podcast/) and get it into your feed.

Here are the stories we plan to cover:

**CISA officials placed on administrative leave**  
Several members of CISA’s election security team were placed on administrative leave late last week, primarily those working on misinformation and disinformation efforts, according to CyberScoop. The move follows the Trump administration’s pressure to scale back CISA’s role in countering election-relate d falsehoods, despite the agency’s past efforts to combat foreign influence and assist local election officials. Former election security lead Kim Wyman warns that shutting down these efforts will hit smaller jurisdictions the hardest, leaving them more vulnerable to misinformation. As of this recording, CISA has not responded to CyberScoop’s request for comment.

**A peak at DeepSeek’s weak security**  
According to researchers at AppSOC, DeepSeek’s R1 large language model failed various security tests for business applications, largely due to a lack of comprehensive guardrails. They found that R1 could not prevent users from creating malware 93% of the time. They could also jailbreak away from system safeguards 91% of the time. The model showed stronger scores when it came to leaking training data, failing in 1.4% of attempts. But overall, the researchers found it extremely easy to cause the model to hallucinate and generate toxic or harmful content.

The average time-to-ransom across all groups was just under 17 hours, but sophisticated groups like RansomHub and Akira showed much faster times of around 6 hours. Ironically, the group Rapid had the slowest time-to-ransom at 43 hours. RansomHub, Lynx, and Akira ransomware groups accounted for 54% of observed attacks. Additionally, 71% of ransomware incidents saw attackers exfiltrate data prior to deploying ransomware.

**Trump taps RNC executive as national cyber director**  
Trump is nominating Sean Cairncross, the RNC’s chief operating officer, as his national cyber director. If confirmed, Cairncross would play a key role in shaping the administration’s cyber policy. This would be the first major cybersecurity nomination of Trump’s administration. The Office of the National Cyber Director was established right before former president Biden took office and advises the president on cybersecurity matters. Cairncross has no known cybersecurity experience but has held various roles in the first Trump administration. His nomination requires Senate confirmation.

**U.S. adversaries increasingly turning to cybercriminals and their malware for help**  
According to a Google Threat Intelligence Group report, adversarial governments are increasingly leveraging cybercriminals and their tools to advance cyber-espionage goals, fueled by resource constraints and the operational demands of conflicts like the war in Ukraine. This trend is also observed in China, Iran, and North Korea, where state-sponsored hackers utilize malware and techniques commonly associated with cybercriminals to enhance deniability and cost-efficiency. Google and other cybersecurity firms warn that this growing overlap between state actors and cybercriminals poses a significant national security threat worldwide.

**UK releases hurricane-grade scale for cyberattacks**  
A product of a group named the Cyber Monitoring Centre (CMC), which is made up of cyber insurance industry figures and some cybersecurity thought leaders, this rating system parallels that of the Saffir-Simpson Scale, which identifies the severity of hurricanes. It is intended to “help cyber insurance companies, and their reinsurers, independently define what constituted a systemic event,” which is one that “emanates from a single source, such as an attack on a vendor, but has a significant impact on myriad other organizations.” As an independent, non-profit organization the CMC will categorize cyber events on a 1-5 scale, with five being the most severe, based on data around the financial impact of the event and the number of UK organizations affected.

**Astaroth phishing kit bypasses 2FA with reverse proxy techniques**  
A new phishing tool called “Astaroth” has surfaced on cybercrime platforms, featuring advanced techniques to bypass two-factor authentication (2FA). First advertised in January 2025, Astaroth uses session hijacking and real-time credential interception to compromise accounts on Gmail, Yahoo, Office 365, and other platforms. Researchers at SlashNext report that it operates via an \*evilginx\*-style reverse proxy, positioning itself between users and legitimate login pages to capture usernames, passwords, 2FA tokens, and session cookies. Unlike traditional phishing kits that struggle to bypass 2FA, Astaroth intercepts authentication tokens in real time, allowing attackers to hijack active sessions before security measures can respond. Cybersecurity expert Jason Soroko warns that this approach renders 2FA ineffective, as attackers can instantly assume control of compromised accounts. The emergence of Astaroth highlights the growing sophistication of phishing tactics and the increasing need for robust security measures beyond standard authentication protocols.

**Sarcoma ransomware claims breach at giant PCB maker Unimicron**  
This breach is the handiwork of a relatively new operation with the delightful name of Sarcoma. The group has claimed responsibility for an attack against Unimicron, a Taiwan-based manufacturer of printed circuit boards (PCB). The group has already published samples of files allegedly stolen from the company’s systems with a threat to leak everything next week if no ransom is paid. The group claims to have 377 GB of SQL files belonging to the Taiwanese company. “Unimicron is one of the largest PCB manufacturers in the world, with plants and service centers in Taiwan, China, Germany, and Japan. Its products are extensively used in LDC monitors, computers, peripherals, and smartphones.”
