POST ID: 1iof7gz / POST TITLE: Which DAST tool do you use in your CI/CD pipelines?
====================================================================================================
I’m curious what Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools does your company use to automate security testing within your CI/CD pipelines? Are you using commercial solutions, open-source tools, or a mix of both?

Some key considerations:

* How well does it integrate with your DevOps workflow?
* Does it effectively reduce false positives?
* Are developers able to work with it efficiently?
* Any challenges or lessons learned from implementing DAST?

Would love to hear about your experiences what works, what doesn’t, and any recommendations you might have.
