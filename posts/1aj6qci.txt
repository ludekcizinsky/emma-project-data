====================================================================================================
Hi , I am using a  tp- link ac1300 with chipset rtl8812bu , I also installed it's driver in Kali and it's up and running but when I try to deauth 5ghz network it doesn't work . Using aircrack -ng .Kali 2023.4 ver . Updated everything. Should I buy a rtl88xxau chipset?

COMMENT TEXT: better place to ask this would be the r/kalilinux subreddit. also googling is your friend, its not the exact same driver (AU vs BU) but might be able to point you in the right direction.  https://github.com/aircrack-ng/rtl8812au/issues/794

COMMENT TEXT: So it is up and running but deauth doesn't work. But does it work in 5 Ghz? For example with airodump-ng?
