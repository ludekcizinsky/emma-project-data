====================================================================================================
# Hey r/cybersecurity👋

I recently built **Link Dumper**, a Python tool that **crawls websites** and extracts important files like and sensetive data::  
✅ **JavaScript files (.js)** – Can contain API keys, sensitive endpoints, etc.  
✅ **Extract Sensetive info:**– APi keys ,version numbers..  
✅ **Recursive crawling** – Finds deeper links & assets  
✅ **Multi-threaded for speed** – Faster enumeration for large sites

🔗 **GitHub Repo:** [https://github.com/walidzitouni/Link\_dumper](https://github.com/walidzitouni/Link_dumper)

This is My linkedin: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/walid-zitouni-634809299/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/walid-zitouni-634809299/)

💡 **Why is this useful?**

* Helps **bug bounty hunters** find hidden attack surfaces 🔥
* Great for **recon & OSINT** to map out websites
* Automates **subdomain enumeration & endpoint discovery**

# How to Test It?

You can try it on:

* **Your own site or localhost** (`python3 -m http.server 8080`)
* **Bug bounty programs** (Check scope!)
* **Deliberately vulnerable apps** (e.g., OWASP Juice Shop)
* **Test sites like** [http://testphp.vulnweb.com](http://testphp.vulnweb.com)

💭 **Would love feedback & ideas for new features!**  
What would you add to improve it? 🤔
