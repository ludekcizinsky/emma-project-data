POST ID: 11kv1y8 / POST TITLE: Deauth won't work
====================================================================================================
So I am new and trying to deauth my phone from my home network. 

And nothing seems to work. The attack runs and I can see that a lot of packets are being sent, but my phone just won't deauth.

COMMENT TEXT: What GHz is your router using ? A lot of wifi adapters (which are used in deauth) attacks only work on 2 GHz rather than the 5GHz most modern routers use

COMMENT TEXT: There is only 1 device connected. 

I noticed that my wifi setting in my phone uses something called randomized MAC. Does it affect the attack?

COMMENT TEXT: Could be the case. MAC randomization hides your phone and gives an artificial MAC adress so that's maybe why you can't attack it. 

I don't know enough about this to help tho. Maybe a quick google about MAC randomization can help!
