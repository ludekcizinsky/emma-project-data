POST ID: 1iu5izt / POST TITLE: Help gauge if our new methodology is perceived as intended. TIA!
====================================================================================================
Hi GRC & CyberSecurity professionals! After lurking for a few weeks and seeing how engaged and informative this sub is, I've decided to turn to you for some help.

**TL;DR:** looking to gauge **your** **perceived understanding** of how our risk management solution works to help our team address any potential points of confusion as our approach is nontraditional. 

Resources to use: [https://www.sibylsoft.com/](https://www.sibylsoft.com/) and [https://www.sibylsoft.com/sibylity-enterprise-data-sheet](https://www.sibylsoft.com/sibylity-enterprise-data-sheet)

\- what is your initial perception about what we do?  
\- what do you believe our unique approach + platform help accomplish?  
\- how is it different from the approach and any RM & GRC tool(s) you use today?

Any other constructive criticism or suggestions are very welcome and appreciated!

Background: 

Before recently hiring me, the company's main focus had been on building out a more effective, intuitive, and cost-efficient approach to risk management. Despite not investing resources in sales/marketing, our founder has organically landed some impressive customers (with signed multiyear renewals). Now that we have a proven approach and fully working product in place, we're ready to get more intentional with our marketing and sales strategy in preparation for an important funding round. 

My goal is to ensure our approach and solution are easy to understand and resonate with the audience, eliminating any potential confusion we can get ahead of. 

I appreciate your taking the time to help me in advance!
