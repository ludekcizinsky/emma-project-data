POST ID: 1inn8tg / POST TITLE: Certification: are they nonsense?
====================================================================================================
So I’m currently thinking about taking a SANS training and eventually certification from GIAC but they’re crazy expensive. The topics within the trainings I’m specifically taking is a bit broad but I’m not sure if taking smaller trainings is more useful? I know this is a very broad question but I’m wondering what are the best kind of trainings/certs with the aim of learning and not with the aim of adding it on the CV
