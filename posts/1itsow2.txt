POST ID: 1itsow2 / POST TITLE: Solution Opinion needed
====================================================================================================
Hello, I am a Cybersecurity Pre sales solution architect having 2 years of experience with a service company. I recently got involved in a proposal for SD-WAN migration from VeloCloud to Fortinet in 10 months. 

From an environment and volumetrics perspective the company they have 402 remote sites and same site acting as DC and HQ and is a Hub Site. They are using Zscaler for Internet breakout and RA VPN. 

For the migration(10 months) part of security configuration I have factored in 1 L4 security architect for assessment and pilot phase and 2L3 Associate Consultant and 1 L2 Ops Analyst for documentation and basic configurations. 

The issue here is that customer is not sharing any more details about the security configurations on top of their VeloCloud SD-WAN so I have to prepare a solution using assumptions. 

My Assumption here is that there should be around 4 DC UTM firewalls and rest around 400 software firewalls.

Kindly suggest if the sizing is fine or if you need any more information to answer please let me know Iâ€™ll share.
