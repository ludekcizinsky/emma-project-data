POST ID: 1ipui9j / POST TITLE: LLM(AI) Model for simulating and/or analyzing a cyberattack, threath detection?
====================================================================================================
Hi,

does anyone know a good LLM(AI) Model to simulate a cyber attack on a resource to analyze the attack and make improvements? 

This kind of AI Pentesting.

* Or for example, I send a list of CVEs to the model, and the model uses this data to suggest practical improvements that can be made to eliminate these CVEs. 
* Or for example the model describes a possible cyberattack on a resource with such CVEs can be realized.

I would be grateful for any thoughts and hints on this topic.



The only thing I found was this model from NVidia.
