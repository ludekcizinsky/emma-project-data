POST ID: 1burrlo / POST TITLE: Open port 22 on zipabox 2 smart home controller
====================================================================================================
I have a zipabox 2 smart home controller in my home. It has zwave and controls a few lights and shutters.

I'm connected to it with a mobile app and through shortcuts on my iphone to a web api to control with siri.

I've recently done a scan of my home network with nmap, and found that among others, the controller's port 22 is open, with nmap identifying it as running "Dropbear sshd 2016.74 (protocol 2.0)".

I've tried logging in with guest, user, admin, and even the email I've registered in zipato as credentials, with root and blank passwords, even running hydra with rockyou.txt. All attempts failed.

I decided to contact zipato themselves, as the zipabox I paid for is in my ownership, and I should be able to log into it. That's also why I haven't been afraid to bruteforce the device.

That's how the correspondance went:

The only terms and conditions/documents I found are:

[The manual](https://www.zipato.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/zb2.main-Zipabox2_user_manual-100x100mm_v1.3_preview.pdf)

and

[Terms of Service](https://www.zipato.com/legal-terms-of-service)

Although the terms of service disallow any bruteforcing and pen testing, it's only with regards to the site/the service which is defined as 'support.zipato.com (the “Site”) and the ZIPATO web-based application including but not limited to my.zipato.com and admin.zipato.com and mobile applications, integration and data linking service accessed through the Site (“Service”)'.

The website/mobile application/admin portal/data linking service have nothing to do with me accessing my home controller through ssh, so it seems that as far as the terms go, I am allowed to do this. 

I just wanted to get yall's opinion on the terms and on how I could ssh into the controller. I looked for vulnerabilities and only found ones that were patched in the version of dropbear sshd present on the controller.

COMMENT TEXT: You'll be fine brute-forcing the hardware you own, but you're unlikely to get access.  
Your best bet would be to either dump the firmware or find a copy of the firmware and try to search for hardcoded ssh credentials. 

You can programmatically control it with some 3rd party software, if that's what you're trying to achieve.

Since the firmware isn't available with a direct download, you'll probably have to perform some kind of MITM operation on the firmware update page to see if you can check where it grabs it from.   
There's also a small chance the user/password/key file are stored in the android APK for connecting to the device.

COMMENT TEXT: Thanks for your reply!
I don’t know if dumping the firmware is the best option since if I’m not mistaken that requires opening the device, and I don’t want to risk ruining it.
Regarding the update, I trigger it from the mobile app and the zipabox updates on its own. It may be possible to perform a mitm attack but the traffic is likely encrypted because of https.

Maybe at some point when I don’t need it anymore it’ll become my foray into physical pentesting
