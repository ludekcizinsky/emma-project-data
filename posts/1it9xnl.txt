Hey fam, 

I know I’m not the only one that feels like security is a money out, but things somehow keep getting worse. More tools don’t always mean better security, contrary to what we’re told and sold. 

I wanted to send everybody this free webinar that Google Cloud is hosting how to crack the code on security. I’ve been assured this will be less “sales pitch” and more “let’s figure this out together.” 

Take a look!
