POST ID: 1iun73c / POST TITLE: Best Credential Leak Monitoring Service
====================================================================================================
I’m currently evaluating different credential leak monitoring services for my organization and I’m hoping to get some input from this community. Our primary goal is to detect as quickly as possible if any employee accounts, credentials, or sensitive data from our domain appear in data breaches, dark web forums, or other illicit sources.

So far, I’ve been looking into the following services:

* **DeHashed** – Seems comprehensive with a big database and API access.
* **SpyCloud** – Promises lightning-fast detection with credential recovery (including cleartext passwords).
* **IntelX** – Strong dark web indexing, even for documents and files.
* **Cyble** – Provides breach monitoring along with threat intelligence and risk scoring.
* **OSINTLeak** – A newer player, but looks promising for OSINT-based breach discovery.

What I’m mainly looking for:

1. **Speed:** Which service detects leaks the fastest?
2. **Coverage:** Who has the widest and deepest data sources?
3. **Dark Web Monitoring:** How effective is their dark web tracking?
4. **API & Automation:** We want to integrate this into our existing security tools.
