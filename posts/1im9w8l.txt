POST ID: 1im9w8l / POST TITLE: Managers, I need your advice
====================================================================================================
One of your reports comes to you regarding an opportunity they had fall into their lap, via a coworker from a previous employer. They haven't applied yet, but you verify the position is open and what the salary range is. Your employee has been with the company close to 10 years and doesn't want to leave, but the pay is substantially more what they're making now. They also recently approached you about advancement to senior position, but that's not in the cards at the moment (not in any part due to the employee). Assuming they're a solid employee, good work ethic, no issues...and they're also your only security engineer, would you attempt to match that salary? 

Posting from a secondary account. Just CMA here...
