====================================================================================================
I'm new to firewalls and haven't done any practical work in a firewall. In work, we are using PA-440 and I want to know every nitty gritty of using it.

What's the best way to practise PA-440?  
Where should I begin with firewalls? What should I do?  
Is there any free labs or softwares to practise it?
