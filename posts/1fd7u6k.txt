COMMENT TEXT: Try to be as active as you can in the community. Participate in CTF‚Äôs, homelab, look for various projects to do. While you‚Äôre studying, start looking for Helpdesk/tier 1 type roles (Cybersecurity isn‚Äôt necessarily an entry level IT role, it‚Äôs possible to break in early, but unlikely) LEARN THE BASICS!!!!!!!!! CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. Learn Hardware basics, Windows/Linux operating systems, Networking basics, probably some Powershell, Bash, and Python as well. Be mindful it‚Äôs hard to safeguard an enterprise environment if you don‚Äôt understand how the environment works so I‚Äôll harp on the basics yet again.

COMMENT TEXT: Expect to hustle for 5-7 years to get to where you want to be. 

Memorizing the facts ... The things that are going to stay the same... Ports/protocols/standards

Master the basics... Build a computer, build a network, then build both in the cloud... Create a Domain, a forest and then do it in the cloud. 

Learn powershell,  bash,  python 

Find your passion and get REALLY GOOD AT IT.

As soon as you can start doing projects, document them, put it on a blog or github. Make a portfolio of the things you can do so when you interview you can show them.

COMMENT TEXT: YouTube is most likely your place my Friend, millions of tutorials.

  
TryHackMe and HackTheBox will teach you a lot, they both have student discounts.

  
BUT, START WITH THE BASICS FIRST! YOU CAN'T HACK ANYTHING IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT WORKS/HOW TO WORK WITH IT!

COMMENT TEXT: Have to agree there so many want to jump into the deep end please please learn the basics it will help you in the long run and you won't have to go back to the basics when you can't figure it out or makes absolutely no sense

COMMENT TEXT: I‚Äôm not sure if this comment is satire, but yes. Think of Cybersecurity as 3 different Domains: Networking, Operating Systems, and Scripting/Coding. Personally my strongest suits are Operating Systems and Networking.

COMMENT TEXT: Why would it be satire? It's a question many software developers have who want to switch to cybersecurity.
