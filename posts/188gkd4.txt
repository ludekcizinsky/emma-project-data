COMMENT TEXT: You have to have skills, but you also have to get past HR. HR doest test your ability to find sqli injection points. They will look for CERTS, experience and schooling. Get your S+ while you study for eJPT. Look up UnixGuy on YouTube. He has a wealth of experience answering this question and sharing his experience trying to do the same as you many years ago.
