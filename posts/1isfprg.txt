====================================================================================================
Some of my Rapid7 event sources are giving me the inactivity notice after I moved them to a new data collector. I have deleted them from the old data collector and only kept 1 in the new data collector. Does anyone know why it is inactive after I moved to the new data collector?

PS: it is working just fine before I moved it.
