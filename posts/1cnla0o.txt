====================================================================================================
I am currently learning front-end development on my own but I want to learn more about how computers  work and then go down the cyber security/hacking world. Would anyone happen to have an resources they would recommend? 

Ideally I want to become well versed in web development, UX, and cyber security. An overall jack of trades when it comes to the digital world
