Hello,

Can anyone share their experience with https://www.blackhatethicalhacking.com/courses/ ?
They are offering 2 courses for half price, is it worth paying?


Thanks!

COMMENT TEXT: Hi im my opinion first you try free resources to see how you're doing. Tryhackme is a good solution üòâafter you can consider a bootcamp ‚úåÔ∏è

COMMENT TEXT: The truth about most paid courses is it's 90% what can be found for free on YouTube and 10% is tempting because of the certificate you can get.

COMMENT TEXT: yeah, but in this case I would not be interested in this type of Cert. I would not mind paying for curated and properly organised content like Udemy values.

COMMENT TEXT: If you want to learn, just start with tryhackme and hackthebox. They have a lot of paths for new people.

Do them with the help of online resources and, when you are ready, buy a real certification path like OSCP.
