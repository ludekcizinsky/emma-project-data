My mom went to us a week ago and when she returns I asked her to buy me a usb rubber ducky, 2 omg cables and a flipper zero I have a ethical hacking course certificate from an online website and I sent her to take a printout too, so my doubt is she is in los angeles right now and when she brings those tools via her carry bag from usa to india how can she bring those and are they allowed and are they safe, Please suggest me as these are ethical hacking tools am doubtful about these
