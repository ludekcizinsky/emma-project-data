Is Entra (Active Directory) a good choice for CIAM? What are some of its flaws and some of its benefits compared to competitors like Okta?

Is Entra a good option for customer/member access management?

Hi all,

Looking to get a new customer access solution for a rather large user base. Asked about Okta yesterday but the team is looking at option and I wanted to ask a couple questions about how Entra performs in space.

The main things we want are MFA and SSO. The main competition right now is Auth0 or the Okta CIS product.

How does Entra perform compared to these? 

Do we need to get the Suite for it to be as good as Okta? Or is P1 or P2 good enough?

What are some of the major problems with Entra in your own opinion dealing with it?

How does it compare to Okta in terms of customer experience? 

We have had problems with adoption before because of friction in the CIAM area.

Thank you!
