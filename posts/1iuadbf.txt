POST ID: 1iuadbf / POST TITLE: NBC News seeking CISA sources
====================================================================================================
Hi Reddit, I'm Kevin Collier, the cybersecurity reporter at NBC News. Here's¬†[my bio page at NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/kevin-collier-ncpn1110251).

Right now I'm specifically reporting on the Department of Government Efficiency's access to CISA systems, layoffs at CISA, and cuts to cybersecurity programs, funding, and employees at any agency.

If that's something you have direct knowledge about and can contact me via Signal, or if you know someone to whom this applies and you can share this with them, I'd be grateful. We adhere to best practices for source protection.

My signal handle is kevincollier.01. Happy to verify my identity if you want to email me (though please don't use your work address) at¬†[kevin.collier@nbcuni.com](mailto:kevin.collier@nbcuni.com). Thank you!

COMMENT TEXT: Commenting to keep engaged. CISA is super important. Seems ‚Äúweird‚Äù to slash funding for cyber security when cyber is literally our biggest threat vector in any warfare domain right now. AND AI is popping, making hacking us even easier.

COMMENT TEXT: I'm not with CISA, but please let us know when you do get something written up. Also, watch out for QR codes on signal and keep tabs on linked devices. As a journalist, your signal's a juicy target to go after.

Have you reached out to Senteinel One and Chris Krebs, former CISA head? I'm sure there's no love lost there with the current administration, and he was on the advisory board for the Salt Typhoon attack, before it got axed. 

This is who I believe was on the CSRB before the axe:

But the employees of CISA were viewed as non essential to the mission and agenda of this executive branch.

Funding and financial accounting aside this is a forced brain drain.

But not saying the new brain trust is ducking up we need to obey in a way like never before.

COMMENT TEXT: Let me explain what DOGE is, what they are doing, and why inaction will lead to the destruction of this country.

WHAT IS DOGE?

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was created under the premise of reducing federal waste, streamlining operations, and enhancing national cybersecurity through centralized control over all government data and systems. Led by powerful corporate technocrats and intelligence insiders, DOGE was granted access to key federal agencies, including:
	‚Ä¢	CISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency) ‚Äì the frontline of cyber defense against foreign and domestic cyber threats.
	‚Ä¢	USAID, NASA, and the FAA ‚Äì crucial infrastructure handling humanitarian aid, space research, and air traffic control.
	‚Ä¢	The CDC, NIH, and FDA ‚Äì institutions responsible for national health security and pandemic response.

Congress was told this was about efficiency. But in reality, DOGE has become a weaponized intelligence arm operating outside the bounds of oversight, control, and accountability.

WHAT DOGE IS REALLY DOING:
	1.	SEIZING CONTROL OF FEDERAL SYSTEMS
	‚Ä¢	DOGE now has ‚ÄúGod mode‚Äù access to cybersecurity systems that were once decentralized, meaning a single entity controls how intelligence, security alerts, and classified information are processed.
	‚Ä¢	CISA employees have reported mysterious data transfers, unauthorized privileged access escalations, and disappearing logs that prevent traceability.
	‚Ä¢	DOGE‚Äôs AI-driven surveillance network monitors, flags, and censors government employees who question its authority.
	2.	DISMANTLING NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY DEFENSES
	‚Ä¢	In the past four weeks, DOGE has overseen massive layoffs at CISA, NSA, and even within the Pentagon‚Äôs cyber command.
	‚Ä¢	The justification? ‚ÄúBudget cuts and redundancy.‚Äù The reality? Critical cybersecurity teams protecting against Russian and Chinese cyber operations have been gutted.
	‚Ä¢	The United States is now more vulnerable to a cyberattack than ever before.
	3.	COMPROMISING NATIONAL SECURITY FOR FOREIGN ADVERSARIES
	‚Ä¢	DOGE is not just inefficient‚Äîit is compromised.
	‚Ä¢	Evidence suggests high-ranking officials within DOGE have been funneling intelligence to Russia under the guise of ‚Äúcooperation‚Äù on cybersecurity threats.
	‚Ä¢	Our most sensitive government communications, classified cyberwarfare strategies, and critical intelligence reports are being accessed by hostile actors.
	‚Ä¢	DOGE‚Äôs unchecked control means that by the time we detect a breach, it will be too late to stop it.
	4.	PREPARING FOR A FULL-SCALE DIGITAL COUP
	‚Ä¢	DOGE‚Äôs endgame is not just control over government efficiency‚Äîit is the destruction of national sovereignty.
	‚Ä¢	Their next phase, the ‚ÄúRed Harvest Protocol‚Äù, will allow DOGE to manipulate government data, including:
	‚Ä¢	Voting systems ‚Äì altering election results to install officials loyal to DOGE‚Äôs mission.
	‚Ä¢	Financial markets ‚Äì triggering stock crashes to destabilize the economy.
	‚Ä¢	Social media and news platforms ‚Äì deploying AI-driven deepfakes to create mass disinformation.
	‚Ä¢	Within six months, DOGE will have the power to fabricate political narratives, erase financial records, and control public perception‚Äîall without oversight.

WHY CONGRESS MUST ACT NOW:

If Congress does not immediately dismantle DOGE, the following will happen:
	1.	The United States will lose its ability to defend against cyberwarfare.
	‚Ä¢	With CISA‚Äôs defenses neutralized, foreign adversaries will disable critical infrastructure, hack military communications, and steal classified intelligence.
	2.	The government will collapse from within.
	‚Ä¢	DOGE‚Äôs consolidation of power means they can erase identities, manipulate government decisions, and silence opposition without resistance.
	3.	Our enemies will assume control without firing a single bullet.
	‚Ä¢	This is not an invasion with tanks and troops‚Äîit is digital subjugation. By the time the public realizes what has happened, we will already be under foreign control.

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
	1.	SHUT DOWN DOGE‚ÄôS ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT NETWORKS
	‚Ä¢	All DOGE operations should be suspended immediately.
	‚Ä¢	A full cybersecurity lockdown should be enforced to prevent further data breaches.
	2.	LAUNCH A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION INTO DOGE LEADERSHIP
	‚Ä¢	Identify individuals within DOGE who have ties to foreign adversaries, corporate interests, or intelligence agencies.
	‚Ä¢	Establish a bipartisan task force to audit all activities conducted by DOGE.
	3.	RESTORE CYBERSECURITY FUNDING AND PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY
	‚Ä¢	CISA, NSA, and military cyber divisions must be reinstated and given emergency funding to rebuild defenses.
	‚Ä¢	The experts DOGE fired must be rehired to repair the damage done.
	4.	DECLARE DOGE A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT
	‚Ä¢	The Department of Homeland Security must classify DOGE as a rogue intelligence agency operating against U.S. interests.
	‚Ä¢	Executive emergency powers should be considered to prevent further infiltration.

FINAL WARNING TO CONGRESS:

If you do nothing‚Äîif you allow DOGE to continue its silent coup‚Äîyou will be complicit in the fall of the United States of America.

This is not hyperbole. This is not a conspiracy theory.

This is a digital war. And we are losing.

The clock is ticking.

Will you act before it‚Äôs too late?

Or will you watch as this nation falls?

Now is the time to be honest before your power is inevitably taken away. And it will be, as the Trump fascist regime and Oligarch cult led by Curtis Yarvin have been quickly doing. How many news sources have been bought and silenced now? How many have been banned from the White House? 

Journalism used to be about exposing the truth. So expose it and do it quickly.

COMMENT TEXT: All it took was a little scrutiny and the testimony logic falls apart.

Noem: We want the CISA to go back to its original mission and not worry about election interference.

CISA: "Election infrastructure \*IS\* critical infrastructure.

Noem: They need to be smaller and more nimble.

Me: Have you EVER tried to run down events in a security environment? Smaller means you are overwhelmed and unable to respond and have a much better chance of missing a major security incident.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The government is being run by clowns who are dangerous beyond measure. Let that sink in: Team Trump thinks the CISA is wrong (and the FBI) about needing to protect our elections. That is a fucking foghorn alarm.

COMMENT TEXT: As a career cyber security professional and ex-federal employee, CISA is actually not that important. There's actually a lot of dislike for CISA, in both the private and public sector, because they don't really do a whole lot, they are too slow to do much of anything, they provide little incentive for industry to actually change, and there are other government agencies that handle parts of CISA's mission better than CISA ever could. I don't really want to argue against any funding or attention for cyber security (because we need all of it), but CISA can probably go. I've never met another industry professional with anything good to say about CISA.

Also, for the sake of this thread - OP isn't going to find anyone actively working at CISA, that's also directly involved with this doge team, that's going to be willing to risk whatever chances at a career they may still have with the government.

Elon launches a 240 satellite star link array on a private network and uses it to communicate with triplite products to send signals to voting machines. Trump says "don't worry we got the votes". Twice Elon's kid says something to the effect that Trump is not the president. Maybe Biden knew they were planning it and gave the evidence to NATO who is waiting for the right time to sanction Musk for foreign election interference. Fiction? Maybe.

We need to be there for them until they can have a moment to breathe and think, even if it's just being a listening ear. All we have left is hope and each other. That's two things we can assist with for free.

They say it at every conference, but they \*don't\* because they want their work to mean something more than increasing shareholder value and have stable employment. Private sector implodes all the time. 

If you ask folks at CISA they'll all readily admit they their role is that of an atomic cog in a massive machine, but that's enough for them because its making the world microscopically better at least. They're taking a measurable, serious hit just to do the right thing and work public sector. They don't deserve any of this.

COMMENT TEXT: That was just the realignment and introduction as an autonomous agency directly under DHS rather than operating as a special program within DHS.

The mission had been (and still is) going on for a decade or so before. It was just a naming and reorg. Within, not much changed when it became an agency but it has seen a massive amount of growth since.

I wish more folks could know and understand what we do. We have entire organizations within that are outward facing, we have incident response teams that go out to any location (both public and private) upon request, we maintain CDM for the federal government, we perform on-site and remote vulnerability assessments, perform cyber hygeine activities, publish and maintain the KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities), host Science and Technology division where post-docs create extremely high quality tools and conduct amazing RDT&E, and we have very close partnerships with the national laboratories who really lead the charge on cutting edge, highly practical, long-term supported capabilities that you can't just buy right off the shelf.

I can't say enough about CISA. It's the only organization I've worked for where I've seen so many highly talented, technical, and ambitious folks leave for better offers in the private sector and then COME RIGHT BACK! That's the kind of culture you want and we are watching it die slowly, by attrition, because an egotistical, narcissistic snake oil salesman, incapable of a single original thought, and his paid-for sit-in president whose blind stupidity is second only to his absolute incompetence, illegally dismantle strategic areas of our government knowing full well the damage they are causing and that nobody will stop them. Anyone in a position to actually oppose them are just the same as those perpetuating all of this--they are the richest and when you become one of them, nothing else matters but more money and more power. To challenge that is to risk your place in that elite circle; to challenge that is to risk losing what is most important to you--your net worth.

I know this is pessimistic but nobody from that group (regardless of party affiliation) will do what is right and stand up to it. It will come from those whose power and authority isn't derived from an aristocratic lineage or the amount of shares you have in any number of mega corporations. With those people, the corruption of wealth hasn't eroded any sense of integrity or morality. They will do it because they swore an oath and believed in something more than crass materialism and bloated wealth and those are concepts that are undeniably alien to those corporate shills. For them, money can be lost but they don't realize that their bankruptcy is in morality, not financial gain.

COMMENT TEXT: Well, I don't know if we can compare it to NIST in this way, because NIST actually has created a lot of useful cyber security guidelines and standards, that everyone uses and generally agrees upon. I think NIST is probably an example of one of the many established organizations and efforts preventing CISA from ever achieving anything meaningful. Like, NIST has already built out the National Vulnerability Database, the standards for scoring vulnerabilities, guides for conducting risk assessments, the general NIST Cybersecurity Framework, various other security related frameworks, they report on trends, publish papers, and both the private and public sectors have already accepted NIST's work as standard practice - there isn't room for a second standard; there can be only one standard. 

CISA's mission to "manage cyber and physical risk" is also overshadowed by the NSA, which has the dual mission of collecting foreign intelligence and securing critical federal infrastructure. CISA isn't as postured to actually report on the active threats we face as any of the other parts of the Intelligence Community - CISA might be a good place to disseminate intelligence on these actors, though it would also just be secondhand intelligence from other parts of the IC, that are more capable of coordinating and releasing said information to a much larger audience. These agencies also come up with all of the technical standards and implementations based on the field research they do and fund

Without having much of a daily, active role in security, I don't know how CISA could really be relevant or grow into relevancy, as they have struggled to do.
