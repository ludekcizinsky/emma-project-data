====================================================================================================
Who is looking at these new products? What are you considering them for? SaaS apps or IaaS/containerized? Whatâ€™s the workflow for handling & remediation? Alerts in the SOC > dev teams? IT ops?

Just curious who the intended audience is for these products and how you might be considering using them in your org.
