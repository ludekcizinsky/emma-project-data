POST ID: 1io1k9u / POST TITLE: Artificial Intelligence and the corporate network
====================================================================================================
Hi all,

I'm looking to hear about how other people deal with users accessing online Artificial Intelligence (AI) resources from their corporate networks

Our organisation has an "Acceptable Use of Internet Resources" policy in place that makes no mention of AI. I have read lots of articles on the pros & cons of allowing users on corporate networks access to online AI resources and, similar to anytime I do research online, find myself none the wiser. Sometimes, it's yeah, sometimes, it's nay and most times, it's.......meh!

Ultimately, the decision to allow (or block) access to online AI resources lies above my paygrade. I do know, however, when someone in senior management eventually gets around to considering it, I will be asked to provide input and implement rule changes on our firewalls.

So I'm looking for some insights/opinions on how others have dealt with this issue. Do you allow, do you block or is it a little from Column A and a little from Column B?

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Best regards,

JP
