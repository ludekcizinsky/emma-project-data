POST ID: 1irwvfx / POST TITLE: Need Fresh Sources for Thesis on WordPress Security â€“ Any Recommendations?
====================================================================================================
Hi everyone,

I'm currently working on my thesis, which I'm doing as a project for a client. The practical part involves creating a WordPress website for them, while the theoretical focus of the thesis is on WordPress security.

In my research, I plan to cover topics such as user management, vulnerabilities in themes and plugins, and more. I'll also be conducting penetration tests and other practical security assessments.

Does anyone have recommendations for good, up-to-date resources that could help with this? I'm looking for things like lectures, videos, articles, interviews, or any other material that dives into WordPress security.

Thanks in advance!
