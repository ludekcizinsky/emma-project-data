POST ID: 1gpg4wc / POST TITLE: Textbooks - Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing
====================================================================================================
Hi everyone!

I am in the process of completing a first level Master in Cybersecurity.

The subject I am most passionate about is ethical hacking, especially in the area of penetration testing, and I would like to delve into all the techniques that belong to this world (VAPT, malware analysis, sql injection, trojan creation, phishing, website violation, ...).

Do you have any books to recommend me that cover these topics? Both texts for beginners that go into the topics properly and manuals for people with a certain level of knowledge already would be fine (in the course we didn't discussed all the topics, so I have knowledge in some of them, while in others I don't have a deep knowledge).

Thank you all very much ðŸ˜Š
