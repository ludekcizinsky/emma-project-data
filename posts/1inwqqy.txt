POST ID: 1inwqqy / POST TITLE: Looking for some survey participants
====================================================================================================
Hello,
I'm working on a final project for my cybersecurity degree and one of my areas of Research is accepted Risk in Software Piracy. If you are familiar with the topic please feel free to take the survey, it doesn't ask anyone to admit to any particular illegal behavior, the results won't be published. The only identifiers it asks for is an age range. Thank you for your time.

::Survey has closed, thank your for your time!::
