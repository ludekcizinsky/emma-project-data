POST ID: 1efmouu / POST TITLE: Cybersecurity writing: Which niche?
====================================================================================================
Hi, I hope you don't mind if I ask you your professional advice.

Iâ€™m looking to revitalize my writing business, which has been focused on general emerging tech, including cybersecurity and data privacy. 

With my background in Peace and Conflict Studies and a PhD in Neuroscience, particularly in debiasing prejudice, ChatGPT suggested I specialize in cybersecurity for critical infrastructures. 

What do you think of that recommendation? 

What specific areas should I focus on, and what are the top concerns for critical infrastructures? As a relative newcomer to this field, which areas offer significant opportunities where businesses need help but are currently underserved, and that align with my expertise and background?

Thanks.
