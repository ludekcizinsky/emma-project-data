COMMENT TEXT: Chatgpt will help you code without scrubbing or sending syntax attacks to your code if you make sure it knows you guys are developing a discord bot. This way you can mess around in a markdown box that gpt recognizes as your code scratch for your bot. Recently erisbot has been released and it was one of my first collaborative projects, and it just kept snowballing. Dream big but remember to do the work!!

COMMENT TEXT: Hey Vavelion, if you want to start with ethical hacking and cybersecurity, first learn the basics like networking, how operating systems work, and some programming. Then, try out hacking tools like Kali Linux and aim for certifications like CEH or CompTIA Security+.

COMMENT TEXT: I used AI to chose me a job to get into and this is very interesting to learn, I did install Ubuntu Linux on an old computer and did a couple things to program something and ai successfuly did it, lost the laptop due to it being sold but now I am on windows 10 learning about ethical hacking and cyber security, use AI for the help it did give me a lot of books to read and a lot of help in getting off the viruses on this laptop I now own 😁

COMMENT TEXT: Oh, now that's just adorable.  
I for once welcome you to this sub and I'm glad you decided to join /r/ethicalhacking  instead of the losers at /r/hacking or worse, kids in /r/blackhat. 

So! To answer your question. Per se, Hacking in the modern IT interpretation broadly means unauthorized access to a system. Usually a remote IT network.

So If I were you I would start with Network concepts. How does data travel through remote locations. Learn about network devices like Switches and Gateways. How are large local networks organized? Then try a little programing. Maybe send your own data to another computer. Then read about social engineering and habitual patterns.  

The end goal is recognizing the weakest link in the System and exploiting it.

COMMENT TEXT: More tools are great! I myself prefer consolidated gpt libraries that use bottom up and top down libraries in harmony to more effectively gather and organize info. My beer money job is out of the tech field, but I have noticed a lot of the same principles are transferable in terms of logic and efficiency. 🧡
