====================================================================================================
I am part of a hacking team at my University and I am looking for a tool that can extract hidden data from a .png file. I tried steghide but I don't know the passphrase used to encrypt the file. I researched stegcracker but It seems that only works with .jpg. maybe I can convert the .png to a .jpg? Any thoughts or recommendations would really be appreciated. I really want be the first to find the flag.
