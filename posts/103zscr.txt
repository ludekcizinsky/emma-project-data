POST ID: 103zscr / POST TITLE: payload doesn't work. it shows (its for older version on android)
====================================================================================================
Hi I am newbie in ethicalhacking(just start learning). I recently learned how to generate payload with metasploit (msfvenom). But when I installed it on android device it show this app is for older version and it doesn't work.(not even open). So I want to know why it is showing this. Is the metasploit framework I installed is old version or what else.
Please help me to come out from that issue.

COMMENT TEXT: I did not understand. Have you installed the app on a mobile device (physical) or an emulator?  The warning comes from the app or the android system?

COMMENT TEXT: So, the app you have installed does not support the version of android that it is installed on the device.

You need to downgrade your android version. You can decompile the app and check the manifest file to find out which version your app supports.
