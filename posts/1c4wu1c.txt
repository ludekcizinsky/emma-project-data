COMMENT TEXT: You definitely need a foundation in networking and it's a great idea to know how operating systems work. Most of the servers out there are Linux based, so some Linux experience would be helpful.

COMMENT TEXT:  No, start with basic Linux distro and use basic tools to gain fundamental knowledge about how things work. And only then jump on kali. 

Try setting up your own web server, simple backend and learn how you can hack your own server, use simple tools like nmap, red hawk
