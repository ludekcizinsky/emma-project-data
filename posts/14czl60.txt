POST ID: 14czl60 / POST TITLE: Help with my checklist
====================================================================================================
Hello, i am a newb scriptkiddie rawr or w/e, Ive just completed quite a few full courses, Ive done the HTBs and tryhackmes, I feel like Im ready to jump into this field at the bottom (and best area imo) bug bounties. I heard in one tutorial about needing a repeatable process, and every other course mentioned the importance of methodology (essentially a repeatable plan). So I wanted to make a General day to day checklist that can be modified by the scope that listed most of what I should be looking for, the tools, and commands for each. I feel I have a fine rough draft, but IK im missing a bit. I keep hearing about IDORs and whatnot, I just dont know enough to add it. tbh I havent actually done the bug bounty course yet, just a bunch of long pentesting courses, so I am sure I am missing quite a bit of what to look for and how, specific to bug bounties, but tbh I just want to hop in. Ive done well over 100 hrs of courses and I feel like I am missing a lot by not hopping in, maybe doing the course as I work through bounties. Long and pointless intro aside, here is my rough draft checklist for Bug Bounties and Pentesting in general. I want anyone who wants to own a newb on how stupid he is, who has experience, to add or modify the list as you please and send it to me. I would appreciate it a lot, I really just want to jump in. Thanks!
