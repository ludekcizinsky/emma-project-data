COMMENT TEXT: Books, blackhat python following its instructions is a great start, also Linux system hardening and hacking methodology books.  Courses may seem easier to do at a faster pace. But books you can take and do the tasks and always have access to your curriculum. I frequently revisit my books for assistance in concepts I struggle with.

COMMENT TEXT: Then I would recommend that you learn some basics. There are plenty of ressources in the internet and there are also books and video tutorials as well as paid courses for nearly everything in the IT world. You should know basic stuff about partitions and formats, protocols (layer model), bash, python and at least one or two other languages and much more. IMO it is not a good idea to start with "hacking", if you have zero knowledge.

COMMENT TEXT: I appreciate the info, Iâ€™ll definitely look into all of that! Is there a specific language thatâ€™s more important to learn than others that youâ€™ve seen?

COMMENT TEXT: Java is for example complete different to Python and therefore good to know. And it is useful, too. For websites Javascript is good to know, as well as PHP.
