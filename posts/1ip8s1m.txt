POST ID: 1ip8s1m / POST TITLE: Anyone been/going to Northsec CTF?
====================================================================================================
And have any tips for a noob? I’m going to Northsec for the first time this May and I’d like to get a feel of what to expect. 
It would be my first time going to a CTF of this caliber and I’ve been working to improve my technical skills. I’ve been in the cyber field for about 5 years now but mainly been focused on threat intelligence and more theoretical stuff so my actual technical skills aren’t great at the moment.
