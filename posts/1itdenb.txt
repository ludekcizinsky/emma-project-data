POST ID: 1itdenb / POST TITLE: Work currently feels really disorganized and draining
====================================================================================================
Hi,

I apologise in advance for any spelling or grammar mistakes, as English is not my first language.

I was thinking a lot about creating this post but my curiosity (and frustration) got the better of me, as I wonder who might be / or might have been in the same situation as me.

I am currently working as a cybersecurity engineer for a company with approximately 2000 employees and also multiple locations in Asia.  
Our team is really small and we are allrounders, doing practically everything that comes our way.  
It was always like this.  
Even back when I was an apprentice, I needed to be able to solve problems related to a huge variety of topics.  
I quickly became part of the backend team, with Linux and Firewalls as my main responsibilities.  
As time went on, we had the opportunity to form a security department, which sparked a new fire inside of me and made me join immediately.

Now I am in my mid 20s and have about eight years of work experience, six of them in cybersecurity.  
Work has never been easy and we were (and still are) understaffed.  
This sometimes means working unhealthy amounts of hours, which had a really bad influence on my personal life in the past.  
One day I realised that I am only benefiting the wrong purpose and I need to take more care of myself.  
I started to think more critically about my current situation and who I want to be and what I want to achieve.  
I noticed that the current work environment and the work ethics of my company do not align with my values anymore.

For example, we are not able to focus on topics.  
There is no prioritisation, as everything is important and needs to be done quickly and is left to rot in the corner afterwards.  
Unfortunately this is not the only thing.  
We often have to suddenly evaluate risk and search for security issues in products or systems which appeared out of the blue and were implemented behind our backs.  
Then again, they ask us to do this in thirty minutes which is just insane.  
I feel like our boss does not care, because I was recently told that he gave his “OK” for some of these systems, without talking to any of us.  
That is of course till there is an incident, which sparks outrage in our boss (“How could this happen???” or “Why is this system not protected???”).  
Developing new skills and in-depth knowledge needs to be done outside of work, as our company sees it as "non work related fun".  
On the other side it is required, since we often have to work on new topics and acquire new knowledge.

This became worse in the last couple years.  
Sometimes I feel like this is a bad joke and it’s becoming more painful each week.  
I tried to talk to our boss multiple times about these issues, but it feels like I always hit a wall.  
He says he “understands” and then nothing happens.  
Projects keep on piling up, as well as tasks and everyone wonders why we drown in work.

Did you have similar experiences?  
I do think about leaving the company and moving on.
