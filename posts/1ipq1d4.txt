POST ID: 1ipq1d4 / POST TITLE: Hunt for SQLi using Splunk
====================================================================================================
Good evening/afternoon/morning to all of you warriors. I’m sure this will be pretty trivial for many in this sub but I’m also well aware of a large amount of novices trying to learn and get into the field or early in their career trying to learn. 

I recently began writing blog posts every once in a while when I get some motivation and decided to share some knowledge on hunting for injection attempts through uri query parameters. It’s most certainly not an end-all-be-all however I think it’s a good stepping stone to build off of and make more specific for certain applications.

Please, feel free to provide feedback, ask questions, whatever. Trying to build some kind of community and would love to tackle some more advanced topics if I garner interest from the community.
