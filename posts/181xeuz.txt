POST ID: 181xeuz / POST TITLE: Simple ways for a small office business to pentest their business / team?
====================================================================================================
(This is a throwaway userID)  
I own a UK business with 12 employees. We are going to do further Cyber Security training in December. We handle client money and are regularly on the receiving end of cyber/phishing attacks.

We want to 'test' the team over the next few weeks with harmless practical tests to identify gaps in training or knowledge. I would appreciate any ideas from this group for how we could \*safely\* undertake some penetration testing on our own business/team. 

Ideas so far include a branded USB left in the car park to see if anyone picks it up and plugs it in (but how do we know who plugged it in?!) and a hand written letter posing from a client asking for something.

Any suggestions welcome...

COMMENT TEXT: AFAIK as long as you are disciplined about POC exploits with empty payloads (not screwing with the system, just showing that at x point someone could do what they want with a shell, remote code execution, etc. ) and post exploit cleanup (not leaving any open ports, back doors, or stored XSS etc. ) you should be able to test whatever you want. Frameworks like metasploit and beef are pretty user friendly and maybe a bit script kiddie, but they can simulate what an experienced attacker might be able to do from scratch if they are really targeting you.

Keep in mind I am pretty beginner myself but the scope of a penetration test really depends on what you want to test. If itâ€™s common sense among employees, phishing emails and malicious redirects should do the trick to help keep people aware. Or maybe you would like to test yourselves on a more serious threat like an APT or randomware attack, in which bringing in a professional network pen tester might be a better idea.

I am still in the learning process myself but this should be a good start to some purple team activity. Good luck

COMMENT TEXT: Thanks! Some helpful points here and some bits for me to research, thank you.

I have since found the Knowb4 phishing test emails which I plan to run on Friday next week.

May then look into more advanced pen testing in due course. Its user behaviour I am focused on at the moment.
