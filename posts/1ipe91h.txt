POST ID: 1ipe91h / POST TITLE: Need Advice: SIEM & Monitoring for an Isolated, End-of-Support Network
====================================================================================================
Hey everyone,

I’m caught between management and IT on a tricky issue. We have an isolated network that is EOS (End-of-Support), meaning any changes could cause downtime—which I will escalate to management for risk acceptance—but at the end of the day, the responsibility still falls on me.

However, management is pushing for monitoring due to regulatory and compliance requirements. Right now, we have no data sources or defined use cases—just a mandate to "implement monitoring."

I'm thinking of starting with agentless monitoring to minimize risk, but I’d love some input on:

Best SIEM for this type of setup (preferably something lightweight and non-intrusive).

Alternative approaches to monitoring without jeopardizing system stability.

Lessons learned if you’ve dealt with a similar situation.


Any insights would be greatly appreciated!
