POST ID: 1inxqra / POST TITLE: Good Security Vendors Hiring versus Employee Tenure
====================================================================================================
I am tired of working for dysfunctional security vendor companies.  I am on my search again for my next job but also getting asked why I job hop during interviews.  I have worked at 3 companies since April 2021 and left each one for different reasons thinking this next company will be so much better.  So now when researching my next role, I look at LinkedIn Insights about the vendor(i think itâ€™s part of my LI subscription).  What my research shows is the average employee (all departments) seems to stay 3 years at the companies hiring currently.

My questions: 
Are there any decent Security Vendors that all their employees have a tenure of 5+ years?
Which cyber vendors would you recommend to stay clear of due to turnover/ a hot mess?
Which cyber vendors would you recommend that seem to have their act together?
