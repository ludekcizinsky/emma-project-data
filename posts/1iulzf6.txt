POST ID: 1iulzf6 / POST TITLE: Most of the tools are free today
====================================================================================================
My colleague and I have some spare time and available savings, and we’re planning to start our own business. We both come from the CTI world, so naturally, we want to focus on something in this domain. We already have a few interesting ideas, but we’re unsure about the direction since the CTI market is saturated, and many tools are available for free.

If you're a CTI analyst or team lead—what's your wildest dream? What tool, platform, or capability would make your day-to-day job significantly easier? What do you see as having the biggest business impact? And where do you see the strongest connection between CTI and other departments in your organization?
