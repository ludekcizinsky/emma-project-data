POST ID: 1in1c6b / POST TITLE: Cloud Security Certification Just Got More Interesting
====================================================================================================
Wiz just launched their new certification program taking the data-driven approach to addressing industry needs.

‣ 57% of companies now operate in multi-cloud environments, demanding broader expertise

‣ Nearly 50% of organizations have exposed databases or storage buckets

‣ The certification program starts with Cloud Fundamentals as a prerequisite for specialized paths

What I find most compelling is how this addresses the growing skills gap in cloud security while providing a clear pathway for professional development.

The multi-cloud reality means we need more certified professionals who understand complex security landscapes. This program seems perfectly timed to meet that need.

What certifications do you think are most valuable for cloud security professionals today?
