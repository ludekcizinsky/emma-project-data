COMMENT TEXT: Think this through, you are downloading a penetration OS, something that has exploits built into it. Of course it's going to flag as a virus. Make an exception for it and try re-downloading

COMMENT TEXT: First, I would download Kali only from the official website and check the SHA256sum. Then you should be safe.

Kali linux contains many scripts and programs for pentesting that will raise alarm bells in antivirus software. So warnings might be no real issue.
