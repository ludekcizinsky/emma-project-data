POST ID: 1impue3 / POST TITLE: Where are we headed?
====================================================================================================
As a community of cybersecurity professionals, what do we think the next 5-10 years will look like? It seems like every new article I read, or video I watch, continues to push the narrative that the days of the technical mastermind are over and employers are only looking for the “jack of all trades”. Is this true? Should I be supplementing my technical studies with business acumen classes? Are there other trends that we may not all see coming down the line?
