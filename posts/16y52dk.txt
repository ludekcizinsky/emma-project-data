COMMENT TEXT: Start by learning Kali Linux; it's a fundamental tool. OverTheWire challenges can help you strengthen your skills. Explore free online resources to delve into specific areas or follow a general path like junior pentesting or red team security. Consider participating in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, and platforms like TryHackMe and PortSwigger for further hands-on experience. Don't forget to build a strong foundation in basic networking concepts; it's crucial for understanding how systems communicate and can greatly benefit your ethical hacking journey.
