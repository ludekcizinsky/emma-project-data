====================================================================================================
Hey guys so I'm running Kali Linux terminal through Userland on my smartphone and everythings running good but I just wanted to know if I can control the amount of ram given to userland for my Linux distro. Would my Linux os automatically use all 8gb ram on my smartphone or does it use a little by default? Can I manually set the amount I'd like to share ?

COMMENT TEXT: No will not use all 8gb of ram on your smartphone. It usually allocates a portion of the available ram for its own use.
But as you're using Userland and it may not provide explicit options to control ram allocation as it abstract the underlying virtualization process and handle resource allocation automatically. 
Tools like AnLinux or Termux would give you more control over your ram.
