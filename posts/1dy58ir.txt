POST ID: 1dy58ir / POST TITLE: Petition to ban users that treat this as a "hacker for hire" sub.
====================================================================================================
As the title suggests, I'm so tired of anyone being able to come on here and post about a "lost account" or "shady app/website." It happens daily at this point.

Is there a way to enforce a minimum karma requirement to post on here? As someone who works in cyber, this sub can be genuinely helpful at times, but it keeps overflowing with these room-temperature IQ requests.

I know we have a pinned post about this topic and a rule, but can we enforce them a bit more rigorously?

Thoughts?

LET'S TAKE BACK OUR SUB

COMMENT TEXT: We have a one strike rule with this, when someone‚Äôs post is removed for that reason they get a message saying if they do it again they will be permanently banned. 

The minimum karma suggestion might be a good idea, I‚Äôll discuss it with the other mods. 

In the meantime, please report any rule breaking posts as you see them, it‚Äôs extremely helpful as we have a very small mod team so we can‚Äôt monitor the sub 24/7, and a repot sends us a notification.

COMMENT TEXT: The one the other day cracked me about getting into an Instagram (I think) that the poster ‚Äúforgot‚Äù the account name and password to. But I do hear ya, it is really annoying and not the point of the sub.

COMMENT TEXT: I just don't know how helpful this is going to be? Like realistically someone comes here, asks for help gets tons "we don't do that" then they never come back. Repeat offenders aren't an issue, so the ban won't do anything but waste mod time IMO

COMMENT TEXT: unfortunately short of straight up locking down the subreddit we can't really force people to improve their reading comprehension. especially when we have the rules listed in the open in addition to a disclaimer when you create a post saying:

"Do not attempt to hire a hacker, or ask how to recover a social media account, or a crypto wallet, or how to hack or dox someone. Any attempt to do so will be removed and further actions will result in a ban. Please read the rules before posting to prevent issues with your post."

Imo, im all for banning them. But all mods need to be in agreement for this before moving on, and banning them wont really help tbh, as most are not repeat offenders. a minimum karma would be a good idea, but at the same time, a lot of these users attempting to hire hackers are posting from normal reddit accounts that have post histories and plenty of karma.

COMMENT TEXT: I think it's because, as professionals, we're used to solving issues ourselves without asking for help. We exchange about new tools and vulnerabilities at most, but we're useful for the newcomers in the industry. Many students ask questions, etc.

COMMENT TEXT: I try to ignore it but when several pop up on the sub feed sometimes I just have to put my 2 pennies worth in! Maybe a big bold all caps pinned post at the top of the sub may at least deter people from asking at all? I don't know, maybe I just spend too much time on here when I could be studying but I do find Reddit a good source of real world knowledge üßê
