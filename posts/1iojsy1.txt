====================================================================================================
Hello everyone, I’d like to share the [Threat Intelligence Report](https://redpiranha.net/red-piranha-2025-threat-intelligence-ransomware-report?utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=Social&utm_campaign=RansomwareReport2025) from Red Piranha with you. Having solid intelligence is crucial for enhancing your detection strategy. Security incidents surged 74.42% in just two years, with US businesses still the top targets. This report covers:  

* Critical vulnerabilities exploited by ransomware operators.
* Emerging TTPs of advanced threat actors. 
* Proactive strategies to mitigate risks and reduce attack surfaces.  

I hope you find it useful in your defence against the rise of the APTs again in 2025. And if you have any feedback please share it in the comments
