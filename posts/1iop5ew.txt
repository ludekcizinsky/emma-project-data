Is it worth it for me to get into?

 I am 28 years old, I have no tech experience, but I am trying to get in the field. I recently just had a baby and got married and I want a better career for my wife and son. I’ve been a plumber/hvac tech for the past 8 years. The work makes decent money but in a trade you’re demanded to work 60-70 hour weeks. I’m never home to see my wife or son. I also have chronic back issues and don’t know how much longer I can carry 300 pound boilers and such. I recently took a liking to cybersecurity and even just tech in general. I am currently in the Google cybersecurity course to get my foot in the door. I am learning a lot and have been successful so far. I’m also self teaching myself Linux and python and have really taken a liking to it! My question to you is that do you think it’s worth it for me to get into the field with zero technical experience, coming from plumbing and hvac? Is 28 too old to get into it? Is there also any advice you can give me? Do I need a degree? Am I wasting my time? I guess I have a lot of questions lol. Thank you so much with who takes the time to respond to this!
