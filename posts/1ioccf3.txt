POST ID: 1ioccf3 / POST TITLE: Any webinars or mixers happening soon? Would love to network with peers!
====================================================================================================
I’m looking to build stronger industry connections—not just for career moves, but to have good conversations, meet peers, and exchange insights. it's been time since I have been to tech meet-ups and webinars so looking out for one. I have shortlisted a couple through my research, but I think it'd be a good idea to take some real recommendations.   
  
I will be in SF until the second week of March. Do you know of any webinars or mixers that might be attending? SignupLinks, name, or just your personal experience with an event would be appreciated. TIA!  
  
Cybersecurity event recommendations would be appreciated. Other tech/IT events would do too.
