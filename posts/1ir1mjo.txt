POST ID: 1ir1mjo / POST TITLE: Feedback Needed: Mobile App to Detect Phishing Websites
====================================================================================================
I'm considering developing a mobile application that helps users analyze websites (received by email ou sms) to determine if they are phishing sites. The app would provide detailed information about the site, including:

* **Hosting Provider:** Identify the web host to check for known malicious hosts.
* **IP Address:** Display the IP address and its geolocation.
* **Trust Score:** Generate a trust score based on various factors like SSL certificates, domain age, and known threats.

The goal is to empower users to make informed decisions about the websites they visit, especially when dealing with sensitive information like login credentials or financial transactions.

I'd love to hear your thoughts on this idea:

1. Would you find such an app useful?
2. What additional features would you like to see?
3. Are there any similar tools you currently use ?

Your feedback is greatly appreciated!

Thank you!
