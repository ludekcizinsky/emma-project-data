POST ID: 1irrhe1 / POST TITLE: Cybersecurity Job Roles
====================================================================================================
What’s up everyone, I’m putting together a big list of cybersecurity job roles. The industry is massive, and there’s way more out there than what you typically see on LinkedIn or job boards. I want to hear from real people in the field:

* What’s your job title?
* What type of company do you work for? (Industry/sector)
* What’s your level of experience and/or certifications?
* If you're comfortable, what’s the approximate pay range and location? (If not, no worries.)
* What does your day-to-day actually look like?

Serious question—so please, no “I make PowerPoints all day” or “I browse Reddit” answers… unless that’s *actually* what you do all day at your job. 

*I am hoping this will be helpful to everyone here—both those new to cybersecurity looking for entry-level role info and those looking to advance or transition into roles that fit them best.* Thanks 🙏
