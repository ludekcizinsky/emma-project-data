POST ID: 1itwoi3 / POST TITLE: Security Operation Center Specialist vs Security Analyst,
====================================================================================================
**Hi everyone,**

As you can see from the title, I just want to know the difference between these two job titles.

I currently have two job offers from two different companiesâ€”one for a SOC role and the other for a Security Analyst position. The salary and benefits for both are quite similar. I just want to understand the difference between their day-to-day tasks.

Thanks!!
