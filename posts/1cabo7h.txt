Curious to know what others think - Is the *FREE* CEH course (“Ethical Hacking Essentials”) enough info to pass the EC-C’s CEH exam? Or do you HAVE to take the paid course as well in order to pass? I get that this depends on the individual, but let’s say you were brand new when you began the free “Essentials” class and only had a fair amount of info you’ve picked up since.
