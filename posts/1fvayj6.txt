COMMENT TEXT: # Red Team Operator

**About CovertSwarm**

Our goal is simple: We aim to compromise our clients, constantly. Our Hives – a specialist team – ‘swarm’ around our targets, always looking for a new way to compromise them. As a result, we provide security insights and advice based upon our client’s technological controls and mitigating solutions, and propose improvements that can be made from a training, process, and physical control perspective.

**The role**

We are looking for individuals with demonstrable Red Team capabilities who are driven to find new or different ways to breach organisations, are capable or desire to find new zero-day vulnerabilities, can adapt attacks to bypass controls, and are relentless at finding novel methods to compromise a target.

The Red Team does not perform penetration tests, and the work we do is not focused on delivering a list of vulnerabilities in a specific application or service. Instead, we emulate the real-world tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of threats that are most relevant to clients, challenging their perimeter security, people, processes, and more.

The position is remote based as we strive to compromise our clients in as realistic scenarios as possible. On rare occasions there may be a need to visit clients in person, such as to deliver physical security or social engineering attack vectors.

**Responsibilities**

* Act as a business contact for CovertSwarm clients, fostering and maintaining relationships with key stakeholders and business partners, ensuring client communication throughout the engagement and contract.
* Propose, plan, and execute Red Team Operations based on realistic threats bespoke to each client to replicate an Advance Persistent Threat (APT).
* Automate attack techniques, creating custom tooling for specific operations and contributing to general-purpose open source tools
* Create high quality actionable, threat-based, reports on security assessment results, which the client is debriefed on fully following the completion of any assessments.
* Consult with application developers, systems administrators, and management to demonstrate security assessment results, explain the threat presented by the results, and consult on remediation.
* Communicate security issues to a wide variety of internal and external “customers” to include technical teams, executives, risk groups, vendors, and regulators.
* Stay informed on current security trends, advisories, publications, and academic research that is relevant our organization

**What we are looking for**

Whether you have a broad knowledge of all-things cybersecurity, or if you are specialised in certain areas, then we want to hear from you. Some of the key areas to note are:

* Network security, including Linux and Windows infrastructure
* Application security, mobile applications, APIs, thick clients, etc.
* Social engineering with phishing, vishing, and in-person engagement experience
* Coding, scripting, reverse-engineering & debugging
* Deploy and managing attack infrastructure for stealth operations
* Teach and mentor other engineers, within the Red Team and beyond
* An adversarial mindset - you must be able to put yourself in the mind of the attacker
* Excellent and professional communication skills (written and verbal) with an ability to articulate complex topics in a clear and concise manner

We are always looking to speak to great people. If you seem like a great fit, we will invite you to a call, even if there aren't any openings as we are growing and will be looking to bring people in over the coming months. So, if you're interested in joining, please reach out! We look forward to getting to know you!

**Benefits**

Aside from working with some of the most talented and passionate people in the industry we can also offer you:

* A fully remote (working from home – ‘anywhere in the world’) role with only the need to travel to client sites when in-person meetings are required, or we are running our quarterly meetups.
* You will not have to use a word processor for report writing – we deliver the results of our endeavours through our bespoke online portal.
* A culture born of vulnerability research. Reporting missing HTTP headers and SSL/TLS weaknesses, and outdated software patch versions is just ‘noise’ in our view. We focus on the actual point of compromise and continually look for new ways to breach our clients.
* Work when you want – That does not have to be a 9-5, but we ask that the job is done well, and core meetings are attended online.
* Software, hardware, and research materials are not bound by strict limits. If you need a resource to deliver to the best of your ability, we will aim to accommodate this.
* Unlimited Training – If it is relevant and will help you, your Hive team, and CovertSwarm to better breach and educate our clients, then you can do whatever training you need to fulfil this.
* Unlimited Holiday – We all need downtime, take it, whenever you need it. There are no prizes for burnout. You work to live, not live to work.
* Private Medical Insurance.
* Company Pension.
* Access to our Electric Vehicle salary sacrifice scheme (UK residents only).
* If you present at a major infosec event/hacker conference, then we will pay your expenses and give you a bonus to reflect this. We want to give back to this great community that continues to help us all.
* No corporate politics – The continued growth of CovertSwarm as a business, the team, and the quality of our services depends upon us being radically candid with one another. Always.

We pay good salaries, have a brilliant culture, and some of our Board are hackers, too! However, if you are just chasing the biggest pay packet, or are driven by your ego, then we are not for you, and you are not for us.

COMMENT TEXT: **Microsoft, Senior Security Engineer**

*Azure AI Platform Security*


The Azure AI Platform security team is seeking a Senior Security Engineer to help us safely usher in the next frontier in AI technology. If you have experience performing security assessments, penetration testing, threat modeling in cloud computing environments, and you are eager to secure the future of AI, we would love to speak with you! 

 
In this role, you'll partner with product engineering teams to assess the security of their services and ensure that we live up to our security promises. You'll plan and manage your own security engagements, from enumerating the attack surface, setting up a test environment, evaluating the design and testing the implementation for security deficiencies, and providing your findings and recommendations for remediation. As you discover systemic issues and anti-patterns, you will be empowered to propose and drive solutions that raise the security bar across multiple services by eliminating entire vulnerability classes. 

 
You should be comfortable reading and understanding code to analyze implementations for potential security vulnerabilities and inform your penetration testing. Familiarity with common web penetration testing tools such as Burp Suite or other intercepting proxies will be necessary. As you dive deep into a given service, you will examine all layers of the OSI stack for the service, ranging from the web UI, the API, the cloud environment, cluster orchestration, and Linux-based nodes and containers. You'll have the opportunity to amplify your impact by suggesting product improvements that provide customers with a paved path to security by default. 

 
Because of the breadth and depth of this role, we do not necessarily expect candidates to have deep experience in all relevant dimensions of the security stack, and security engineers new to the AI space are encouraged to apply. We seek well-rounded individuals, and we leverage each other as appropriate to create a well-rounded team. While technical fundamentals are important, the ability to navigate both technical and organizational ambiguity, go deep in unfamiliar domains, independently develop subject-matter expertise, and build trust with partner teams will be required to succeed in this role. 


*Qualifications*


* 5+ years experience performing security assessments and penetration testing 
* 3+ years experience securing cloud computing environments
* 3+ years experience with one or more of C#, Python, Rust, or JavaScript, PowerShell 


The typical base pay range for this role across the U.S. is USD $117,200 - $229,200 per year. There is a different range applicable to specific work locations, within the San Francisco Bay area and New York City metropolitan area, and the base pay range for this role in those locations is USD $153,600 - $250,200 per year.


Note that this is only base salary - you will also receive an equity grant in the form of RSUs and an annual bonus.


If you're interested, you can send me a direct message on reddit, or apply directly via our [careers site](https://jobs.careers.microsoft.com/global/en/job/1774365/Senior-Security-Engineer).


This job is open to remote candidates, but you must be based in the US, willing to align to roughly PST timezone working hours, and have existing authorization to work in the US. Visa sponsorship is not available for this role. If you prefer to work in the office either full or part time, relocation to the Redmond, WA area is available.
