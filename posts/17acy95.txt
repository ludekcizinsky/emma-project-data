ive been wanting to take an ethical hacking course lately but i cant find myself deciding deciding on which course to choose (htb or tryhackme). 

Are there any better courses than these two?

COMMENT TEXT: THM is for learning how to hack/pentest and other basic things like linux/networking.

HTB is where you have vulnerable machines that you can pentest against. It also has learning paths but they are much more expensive than THM.

Ultimately it depends on where your skill level is. If you're a beginner I'd say start with THM.

COMMENT TEXT: Don't waste your time on HTB,  I have been trying for two weeks to get exercises completed and I've spent  the past week,  getting the machine to open and keep open a VPN.  By the time I get to the end of an exercise for the 7th time today because IP address are lost.  

I AM A 30 YEAR IT PROFESSIONAL,  THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE EXERCISES THEY ARE VERY INFORMATIVE. 

THE HARDWARE ENVIRONMENT ON HTB IS PROBABLY STRAINED TO THE MAX.  

7 TIMES TODAY TO GET A NEW IP ADDRESS THAT THE PWNBOX LOOSES THE IP CONNECTION. 

  
YESTERDAY,  8 HOURS TRYING TO CONFIGURE AN ENVIRONMENT FOR EVIL-WINRM,  WENT TO A PWNBOX CONNECTION AND WAS DONE IN UNDER AN HOUR, BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENT IS CONFIGURED CORRECTLY.  TODAY THE PWN CONNECTION CAN'T HOLD AN IP ADDRESS FOR MORE THAN 15 MINUTES.

COMMENT TEXT: Agreed. Start with Tryhackme and do all the free paths you are interested in. Then itâ€™s only about $10 a month for access to all the advanced lessons. Hackthebox academy is good as well but more expensive and last I checked it uses a subscription based virtual currency called cubes to buy course packages which is super annoying.

COMMENT TEXT: Here's my similarities of both HTB and THM

UI: THM is often considered more user-friendly and straightforward, especially for beginners, while HTB has a more advanced feel that might appeal to experienced users.

OpenVPN: THM typically offers quicker VPN setup, and its connection times are often shorter because it is more beginner-focused, providing easier access. HTB may take slightly longer due to its more complex infrastructure, especially with the free config files.

Boxes: THM is well-known for beginner-friendly content and guided learning paths, while HTB offers more challenging and technical exercises that cater to intermediate to advanced users. the assessment that THM focuses more on real-world challenges and technicalities is quite accurate, as THM provides structured, real-world learning paths, whereas HTB is more of a freeform, figure-it-out-yourself approach.

you should start THM first then go to HTB if you already grasp technicality.
