POST ID: 1it7nsn / POST TITLE: MDR Analyst vs. Lead Security Engineer in Crypto – Which is the Better Career Move?
====================================================================================================
Hey everyone,

I’m at a crossroads in my career and would love to get some advice from the community. I have 5+ years of experience in cybersecurity, primarily in SOC operations, threat hunting, security automation, incident response, cloud security. I'm now considering two roles:

1. MDR Analyst – Focused on threat detection, response, and intelligence, likely deepening my expertise in incident handling and advanced threat analysis.
2. Lead Security Engineer (Crypto based Company) – A broader role involving Endpoint security, Incident Response, Cloud Security, Threat detection, Security Architecture and possibly governance/compliance but in a niche crypto environment.

My goal is to move to the next level in cybersecurity, not just specializing in one area but gaining exposure across multiple domains (offensive, defensive, engineering, governance, etc.). I want to ensure that my next role sets me up for long-term growth and leadership opportunities.

Which role do you think would be the better choice for someone looking to build a well-rounded cybersecurity career? Also, how valuable is crypto and web3 security experience in the long run?
