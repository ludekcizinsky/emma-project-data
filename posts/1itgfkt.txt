POST ID: 1itgfkt / POST TITLE: Backend Dev Looking to pivot into CyberSec
====================================================================================================
Hey! I'm a backend developer - spent most of my time in the federal sector and job security has become a major concern. 

I've been thinking a lot about transitioning into cybersecurity, and this seems to be the right opportunity to get my feet wet. Any other back end developers that have made the jump? Would love to hear about your experiences.
