POST ID: 1iw2ma0 / POST TITLE: The Art of Self-Healing Malware: A Deep Dive into Code That Fixes Itsef
====================================================================================================
Hey everyone,

I recently went down a rabbit hole researching **self-healing malware**‚Äîthe kind that **repairs itself, evades detection, and persists even after removal attempts**. From **mutation engines** to **network-based regeneration**, these techniques make modern malware incredibly resilient.

In my latest write-up, I break down:

* How malware uses **polymorphism & metamorphism** to rewrite itself.
* Techniques like **DLL injection, process hollowing, and thread hijacking** for stealth.
* **Persistence tricks** (NTFS ADS, registry storage, WMI events).
* How some strains fetch fresh payloads via **C2 servers & P2P networks**.
* **Defensive measures** to detect & counter these threats.

Would love to hear your thoughts on how defenders can stay ahead of these evolving threats!
