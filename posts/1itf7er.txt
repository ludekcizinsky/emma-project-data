POST ID: 1itf7er / POST TITLE: Cyber Responsibilities
====================================================================================================
Hoping for some industry guidance here on who is ultimately responsible for cyber security risk assessments when a non IT business unit wishes to introduce or in some cases have already gone ahead and procured a new system be it on-premises or cloud. 

Background: 

Up until 6 months ago I was the sole cyber security administrator in a large company. I’ve 7 years in cyber and 3 as a network engineer/systems administrator. We recently recruited a Masters Cyber Security Graduate to assist me but it’s his 1st role since graduating and has limited previous IT experience. 

It’s a really small IT team with 2 systems/ network admins and 2 applications/dev admins and a part time DPO.

We are heavily audited both by an internal auditor and by our national cyber security centre under NIS and NIST CSF. 

I’m open to further question to add more context if needs be.

Issue:
Recently I’ve found that non IT business units are awarding contracts for cloud based systems / on-premises IoT / Scada and with only the local IT admins / cyber team an afterthought. 

My questions for you, my experienced colleagues is : 

Hypothetically in your organisation HR wish to procure a new cloud based LMS for employee training, they’ve narrowed it down to 3 products they feel meet their requirements.

At what point should they engage with local IT?

Where would cyber risk assessments enter the picture.

Who is ultimately responsible to ensure a risk assessment is conducted. 

Thanks in advance
