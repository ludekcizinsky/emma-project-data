POST ID: 1ihz6x3 / POST TITLE: Substitute for immunity debugger
====================================================================================================
I am new to ethical hacking and I am trying to learn how to do all this, but the course I'm learning from says to use immunity debugger, and it seems like it's been absorbed by a company and they won't let people who don't work for them use the program. 

What is a program I can use instead?
