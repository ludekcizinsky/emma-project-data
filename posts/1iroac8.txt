POST ID: 1iroac8 / POST TITLE: GSEC exam tips and resources
====================================================================================================
Hi All, I’ve been asked by my employer to take up the GSEC exam from SANS. The course material though is exorbitantly priced at $8,780. There’s no way I can afford the course material and my employer would not be able to cover the cost too. Could you please suggest me alternate resources to help me pass the exam. Thanks in advance!
