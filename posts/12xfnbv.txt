COMMENT TEXT: if it's your own wifi network you can do this using the router's admin console. there's no "hack" required.

COMMENT TEXT: in the heart of this isn't hacking, OP if you log into your router via web browser typing 192.168.0.1 as the url you can log in usually with 'admin' 'password' or your router will have the login either on the back or in its manual...  you can use this to block devices from connecting to your network.  highly recommend changing the default password too.

COMMENT TEXT: I've tried this, but it doesn't work.  I called my ISP and they said that they control the admin side.  I told them my intentions and they said that I would have to purchase a private (third party router).  So, I posted this to see if purchasing the router is the only option available.
