Using Aircrack Without A Wifi Card?

Is there any decent way to use Aircrack or other wifi based pen testing tools without having a wifi card? 

The current one in my laptop isn’t capable of monitor mode.

COMMENT TEXT: Im... what? 

You want to interact with wifi without a wifi card or adapter?
No. 

You can buy them for very cheap. 
TP-LINK AC600 is cheap and offers monitor and injection mode. 20 bucks, is dual band and has decent range. 

Or the Alfa adapters. Most have monitor mode.

COMMENT TEXT: Just buy an external wifi card which allows monitor mode and maybe injection mode for the desired frequency.

COMMENT TEXT: I didn’t realize I was lucky, but my intel WiFi chip does have monitor and it’s like a 15 year old Toshiba satellite. I guess maybe for business users they thought of that, idk. Didn’t realize it was a luxury. Still got the Alfa though because duh. They’re so cheap just pick one up.

COMMENT TEXT: Jeah, few offer that. 

Buy an adapter. You can look on aircracks website which work. Or google for which have monitor. 

I'd go with the TP-Link for a start.

COMMENT TEXT: Maybe one with detachable antenna, so you can use whatever antenna you want. 

If you do not need long distance, just stick to the mini usb stick. AC600 is fine.

COMMENT TEXT: listen..
i don't mean to be rude or anything but since you're new to this, you should start developing a habit of searching the internet for literally everything that you need, and getting really good at knowing somewhat, what the issue is.
do not rely so much on people.. i mean if they were able to learn all that, just by themselves(assuming), and searching around, then surely, you can do it too.

or.. if you're a bit more lazy, you can simply ask ChatGPT. with the right context given to gpt,
IT WILL TELL YOU EVERYTHING!

and read documentations of the stuff that you use, like: "man <the shell program>"

good luck mate :)
