====================================================================================================
 Is it that difficult to get a remote job moving to countries like Thailand? Iâ€™d like to work for a company located in Europe for example but living in Southeast Asia. Is that an impossible dream? I am looking forward to hearing your opinion about this or if you know any successful stories from friends or other colleagues. This is kinda important for me because my girlfriend is Asian so I wish I could get a job staying in her country. Thanks <3
