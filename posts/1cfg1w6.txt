Let me give you a hypothetical,you were poking around a piece of software trying to bypass the licensing, but in doing so you found a critical vulnerability that exposed thousands of users, names and addresses. What would you do?

COMMENT TEXT: [CVD](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure) - However, I would also feel obligated to report my discovery to my local authority data protection service (UK here, so that'd be the Information Commissioners Office).

You don't have to say WHY you found that.

COMMENT TEXT: I concur that disclosure is the only solution, my question is more how would you disclose rather than should you

COMMENT TEXT: I would get a lawyer involved.  Different countries have different policies and laws, and it seems possible you could be accused of something.  Disclosing the bug to the company through a third-party with your interests in mind will be safer.
