COMMENT TEXT: Add more details. What is your setup? Have you changed the .conf file? Are you using ntlmrelayx as well? 

This is a guess game without details.

COMMENT TEXT: The box is called responder it is in starting point htb.

I somehow picked up one request for my xbox. Which was the only thing.

I changed the responder.conf to http off. I tried it with http off, https off, dns off, and all of them on as well.

It's literally not pulling any information. I've never used responder before ive mainly stuck to nmap and metasploit as well as burpsuite. 

I'm not sure is your asking if I tried it on my windows active directory? But assuming you are no I haven't I only have linux on this computer. I have a mint and kali.

Should I try to run my xbox to see if I pulls the request??

COMMENT TEXT: Sorry for the late response.

Have you found a vulnerability on the box? Like sqli?
Or lfi?

If you can exploit one you can get a hash.

Let HTTP on if this is for the initial foothold.

COMMENT TEXT: I'm on kali. It's up to date. 

I am doing hack the box so I changed the .conf to what was necessary to complete their machine. 

I'm using openvpn from hackthebox. I have noticed that my ip address isn't changing to the one from the openvpn. 

When I run Wireshark I am only receiving packages from wlan0 eth0 and any, but none for tun0.

No I'm not using ntlmrelayx. I wasnt told that I needed it. 

I was throwing an error for port 53 so I stopped that. Started then threw and error for about 20 ports and stopped apache.

 I have tried it with my ufw enabled and disabled. 

I have my dns set to 8.8.8.8 and and the dnsstublistener to no in my /etc/systemd/resolve.conf.

I am using a dell from 2013. I got from a friend. However, I've had a lot of problems with the i915 drivers. 
 
I say that because trying to fix that alone has taught me a significant amount about how my system itself functions. I haven't felt as clueless about kali as have at this point until yesterday since I first startedðŸ¤£.

Idk what else I could tell you that would help as I am still learning. But will tell you whatever I can if that's not enough. Thanks for your time though, I genuinely appreciate it.
