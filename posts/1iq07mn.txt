====================================================================================================
To everyone who is not professionally working in cybersec, and only started it as a hobby, and became enough capable to match industry grade professionals, I have a question.

When I was a kid, I always wanted to do something big, something revolutionary, I don't know, I probably sound like an idiot in a utopia, but yea, in short I always had a knack for cracking things open, to just be able to snoop on others, but like with no wrong intention. I mean, it just satisfies me how much power I wield and how much I can use it to do something actually good in this world that is rotting.

I don't know, but I wanted to see if there were individuals who thought kinda like this and are actually very competent even though it isn't their domain.

I really want someone to look up to. I mean, I want to do something, something good, and right. I want to see if that's possible, I want to know if what I want to do is actually doable. I could just shutup and learn myself instead of putting it down here but, I just want to connect with my type of people.
