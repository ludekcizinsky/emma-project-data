====================================================================================================
Ill try to describe the problem best as i can.

Here we go.

I need to extract bash\_history file of admin user. Obviously a dont have a permission to /etc/shadow and etc. The only thing that i have to use is something called "Archiver", which archives all the files of regular user to /var/backups and store it in file 'home-regular-user.tar.gz'. The box doesnt have 'file' command to identify the type of file,but it surely not a regular tar file (I tried to decompress it, the output was "not in gzip format")

I tried to relocate The Archiver to gain permission,and i succeed,but i dont really understand what it gives to me.
