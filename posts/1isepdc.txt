POST ID: 1isepdc / POST TITLE: Is CISSP still worth it?
====================================================================================================
Hey,

I've been working in cybersecurity for five years, primarily on the sales engineering side. At some point, I'd like to pivot into the industry, maybe as a Director of Cybersecurity or something similar.

At the same time, I feel like I have some gaps, especially in areas like cloud, Kubernetis, Python, and so on. My background is very strong in network security, (expiered CCNP, expired NSE7)

Would the CISSP be worth it for me, or would I be better off focusing on Kubernetes, AWS, and related technologies?

I also see that CISSP has a strong community, which could be helpful for landing my next role.

Appreciate any insights!

  
E: Thanks for all the responses, I will go for CISSP and try to get the check in the resume. I will update my expierence and progress if it was all worth it or not afterwards :) 

After the CISSP I will go down the AWS route and get more knowledge there, I am hopeful that I can finish CISSP within 4-8 weeks.
