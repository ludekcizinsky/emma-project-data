POST ID: 1c96m2w / POST TITLE: EC Council CEH certification 
====================================================================================================
Good day everyone. As a college student, I wish to express my progress in completing 75% of CEH course from another sources. Unfortunately, I currently lack the prerequisites for the exam, either two years of industry experience or purchasing the course directly. Given these constraints, I respectfully seek guidance on alternative entry-level certifications that I could pursue at this point in time. Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

COMMENT TEXT: I actually wouldn't consider the CEH entry level, but that's just me.

For entry level, you'll want to look at the CompTIA line - Net+, Sec+, CySA+
