COMMENT TEXT: Please post the output of `command -v apktool`. Please post the output of `echo $PATH`.

Use `hash -r` to clear Bash's program cache. Bash should find the updated program in `/usr/local/bin`.

You could always use the full program name to invoke the program: `/usr/local/bin/apktool <opts>`.

-----

If `apktool` has a bunch of files and needs a `CLASSPATH`, then here's how to do it. Copy the Apktools folder to somewhere `/usr/local` or `/opt/apktool`. Then setup a wrapper script to call it properly. Below, pretend `fop` is `apktool`. (`fop` is a java program used to build DocBooks. It has several jars, and it needs its `CLASSPATH` set).

```
$ command -v fop
/usr/local/bin/fop

$ cat /usr/local/bin/fop
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Set JAVA_HOME if not set
if [[ -z "$JAVA_HOME" ]]; then
   JAVA_HOME=$(readlink -f $(command -v java) | sed "s|/bin/java$||")
   export JAVA_HOME
fi

# Set CLASSPATH for fop
CLASSPATH=/usr/local/bin/fop-2.8:/usr/local/bin/fop-2.8/lib
export CLASSPATH

# This calls the real fop, and passes all arguments to it
/usr/local/bin/fop-2.8/fop/fop $*
```

With the `/usr/local/bin/fop` script in place, I can just call `fop` and everything works as expected.

Related, I used Apktool about 12 or 15 years ago. I seem to recall it was abandoned, and you need to use another tool nowadays. But my knowledge is  really dated. Maybe someone else has current knowledge of the state of affairs.
