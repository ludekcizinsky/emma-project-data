====================================================================================================
Hello, new to the sec world. Company does not want to pay for Defender XDR and eventually Sentinel for testing purposes. Iâ€™ve used all my mobile numbers and cards to set up free trials. Planning on just getting Defender XDR and possibly Sentinel to set up a home environment lab. Have any of you guys done it? If yes, any advice? What is the most cost efficient way to do that?
