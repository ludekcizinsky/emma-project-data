POST ID: 1bqw6un / POST TITLE: Top cyber criminal groups 
====================================================================================================
Is there any reliable source and updated to know the most active cyber criminal groups?

Tried Google but don't get something useful. Maybe I am using it wrong. 

I'm conducting a thesis to go through an attack, but'll need trustworthy info of cyber criminal groups currently active.

COMMENT TEXT: The term you are looking for is APT, advanced persistent threat. You can google that for more info.
