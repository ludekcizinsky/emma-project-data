POST ID: 1iu0cof / POST TITLE: New to OT/ICS Security
====================================================================================================

Hey everybody didn’t know where to go with this, but thought I would reach out to the community. I just recently started a job at one of the leading OT/ICS cybersecurity companies think Nozomi Networks or Claroty. I’m an SDR there so my main goal is to just try to gain interest enough for a potential customer to want to see the technology in action and discuss similar use cases.

I don’t have a background in cyber so everything is pretty foreign to me but the training has been great so far. I’m focusing heavily on our healthcare sector as well (IoMT)

My question is what type of questions would you ask someone to want them to take a meeting to see our tech and what type of objections or roadblocks should I expect? What are the biggest challenges right now with OT/ICS environments?

Any help or recommendations would go a long way as I know OT cybersecurity is pretty niche.

Cheers
