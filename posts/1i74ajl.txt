COMMENT TEXT: amazing article. Pleasant to read and entertaining. Related metioned too, to cool ðŸ˜Ž. Ethical and caring.
just sad that you had to keep technical details for later, especialy for the IDOR, as i think local router/box from ISP seem, in general, not design with security. So i may want to try it too one day, sparing time for doing it ony home ISP box.

COMMENT TEXT: Yeah. When it comes to disclosure a lot of it is controlled by vendor. So did not expose much. But wanted to post this for the story. For my other posts will definitely include :)
