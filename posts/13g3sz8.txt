POST ID: 13g3sz8 / POST TITLE: How do hackers get caught/traced? and how do they remain unfound?
====================================================================================================
I always notice these showswhere they trace a hacker and find them.  What are these hackers doing to protect themselves and remain anonymous?  Also how are people finding them?  I am pretty new still learning to use powershell so please explain in a way a beginner could understand :)

COMMENT TEXT: How they get caught? Poor OPSEC, laziness and complacency.

How to remain unfounded? 24/7 good OPSEC, make no mistakes and have nothing fail or leaks.

COMMENT TEXT: Logs. Bragging. Mistakes. People who know who you are telling authorities. Just don’t do anything illegal and you have nothing to worry about. There’s tons of free resources and ways to make money hacking legally.

COMMENT TEXT: Serious company clone their system and servers, than place honeypots (open some ports, privileges etc..) and wait hackers. In that way they record their digital signature and technique of hacking.

COMMENT TEXT: The company will be protected to the extent that it provides access to data to cyber engineers. So yes, they just expose just their cloned systems and servers. In a large number of cases, a breach occurs when an employee of the company creates or enables access to hackers.
