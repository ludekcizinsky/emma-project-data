POST ID: 1iqdmcx / POST TITLE: Has anybody gotten a job on LinkedIn?
====================================================================================================
It seems like there are always 10,000 open Cyber jobs on LinkedIn and I have applied for 5-10 a day for the last 6 months. Not just blasting apps but mindfully applying and customizing cover letters and resumes to 5-10 a day. I’ve gotten 1 video interview and it was a joke. I have 5 years of Security Administration experience — heavy on SIEM, Cloud, and Threat Analysis & Incident Response, Bachelors degree in Cyber, Security+. Seems like these job postings are just there to keep people using the app?  Dead internet theory?
