====================================================================================================
Hello Everyone, what platform do you use to train your developers?

We have a team of around 50 devs, and I'm looking for a good price/performance platform to train our developers on secure development. I'm not looking for a tick-the-box training but an actual way to increase and develop skills. It should include hands-on (labs).

  
Thanks in advance.
