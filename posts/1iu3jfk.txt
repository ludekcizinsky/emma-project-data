====================================================================================================
With AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini everywhere, how are orgs in youur network handling **security risks**?

AI boosts productivity, but also raises concerns—**data leaks, compliance (HIPAA, SOC2, CCPA), insider threats**. Some companies ban AI outright, but feels like a short-term fix. Others exploring **secure AI gateways** that redact sensitive data before it hits the model.

Curious—how is ur security team handling this? Internal solutions? Third-party tools? Just policy-based controls? Would love to hear thoughts from this community!
