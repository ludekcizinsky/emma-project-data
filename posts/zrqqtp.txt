POST ID: zrqqtp / POST TITLE: Pentest tutorial
====================================================================================================
Is anyone with a lot of experience willing to show me how to perform one pentest from start to finish? I am currently doing a Udemy course, and while it is helping a lot, I need to see the process from start to finish, and i think I'll be able to figure it out from there. My company is aware that I don't have pentesting skills and they're giving me some time to learn it. Tips, tricks, and tools will help. Thanks, everyone

COMMENT TEXT: hackthebox has 5 tutorial machines that help a lot, and I think actually doing them would be beneficial. 

If you need more you could google for a walkthrough of one of the machines. The nice thing with this is you can follow along.

You can also find lots of exactly what you're looking for on https://infosecwriteups.com/

This one might be a good start, from my very minimal research https://infosecwriteups.com/basic-pentesting-1-walkthrough-vulnhub-4dac91b416ff
