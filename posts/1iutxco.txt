COMMENT TEXT: This is not in the least bit surprising. The politicians have been told time and time and time again that there is no such thing as safe back door for the ‚Äúgood guys.‚Äù And Apple has been very clear that they would not be doing that.

FAFO, as the kids say.

COMMENT TEXT: I'd think that ADP might well be enabled by some Corporate businesses to keep documents, notes etc safe.  I wonder what they would do?  Probably move to some Zero-Knowledge Service like Tresorit, or even Mega

COMMENT TEXT: Trying to understand what‚Äôs best practise now if anyone can help?
Always security conscious and have password manager installed so have turned off keychain, are apps like password managers safe from these changes?
Is it better to turn off keychain?
I have iCloud as I presumed when I change phones or lose phones for example I can sync everything to a new device, is this correct?
If I turn off iCloud will I not have that feature?
Sorry if it‚Äôs basic but I‚Äôm not sure any feedback welcome
Thanks

COMMENT TEXT: So, let me get this straight. So that the UK may be able to imprison some people hurting people's feelings online, all of it's citizen will have their data stored unencrypted in apple's server? Apple? Who famously leaked nudes from like half the planet through icloud, including half of Hollywood?

Cool, cool, cool. I see the UK has elected to leave their brains at home before going to work.

COMMENT TEXT: Lights go down... fog rolls out... Laser light show begins... \*DON'T CALL IT A COMEBACK\* starts blasting on speakers and iTunes bursts thru the curtains to uproarious cheers from the crowd, a few people faint, others are chanting "Bring back the Shuffle, Bring back the Shuffle" 

iTunes raises its hand to quiet the crowd... murmuring and whispers can still be heard... 

Then the words that rocked the world are heard loud and clear...  
  
"iTunes is BACK World!" 

The crowd LOSES it, camera flashes fill the room, tears are seen rolling down cheeks... 

The time for local storage is back!

I personally am moving my accounts off of Google (Android users) and switching to de-googled lineage os with my pixel 3a XL from yesteryear. I don't want no AI powered anything in my pocket.

COMMENT TEXT: All data is transferred to and from iCloud is encrypted end to end, but Apple has the private key to decrypt it for you to be able to shared content on say your iCloud Drive to others. 

With ADP enabled, the private key is on your device, and so you cannot share iCloud content with others, your syncing encrypted data to icloud for storage, nothing more. As Apple does NOT have the private key, they cannot decrypt it at their end.

This is a kick in the teeth for the UK, even if law enforcement need a warrant to request the data.

This is all for the protection of children, and to root out terrorists, a tiny number of people, if any, here in the UK.  Just feels like a power-grab.

COMMENT TEXT: As someone that manages Apple devices in a corporate setting, those Managed Apple ID accounts are laughably inadequate for typical enterprise business requirements. They only come with a bog standard 5GB of cloud storage, and there‚Äôs not a super easy way to manage a user‚Äôs personal data after offboarding. You‚Äôd be much better off with an enterprise solution like Tresorit, CrashPlan, OneDrive/SharePoint/Teams, DropBox, Box, Google Drive, etc.

COMMENT TEXT: I haven't checked, but I'm guessing icloud backups are geo-located to the country your reside in? So residents in the UK have their data backed up to Apple's cloud in the UK and so on..

COMMENT TEXT: Thanks for confirming - are files from the device synced to iCloud by default, or does the user have to enable this, separate to whether or not ADP is / can be enabled?

As I understand it, some of the published breeches involved people attacking the iCloud login rather than the device itself, which provided access to synced data.

If it's enabled. Back when I still had an iPhone I had everything disabled and only did backups via iTunes.

COMMENT TEXT: So did I. But iTunes was destroyed and the hability to sync locally was made incredibly hard. Same with 1Password, there was a handy local sync WLAN feature and they destroyed it to force everyone on their stupid cloud sync online account which of course you must pay a monthly subscription for.
