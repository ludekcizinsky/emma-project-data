POST ID: 1is3mo2 / POST TITLE: Hesitant about new position
====================================================================================================
Hello so i will be quick and to the point as the title says i got my first corp job after uni graduation "bachelors in media engineering & technology" aka software engineering.

I tried work as a web developer and later on i found my passion in cybersecurity, since then i got certified Security + , now working on SOC Level 1 on tryachkme and since graduation i am applying to jobs. I applied to over 70 security jobs even admin jobs and technical support, and the only answer i got was from a Digital media distribution company asÂ **a Data Input/Output Specialist.**

My job is to make sure data goes from point A to B on time and securely. There is a lot of security but mostly in practice and not very technical (stopping attacks, exploiting, scripting.. etc). I like the company but for that reason i am afraid i am wasting my knowledge or am overqualified and settling to the only response i got. It feels like a system admin almost fulfilling ticket requests through a queue (as best as i can explain it)

Lastly, I wanna make some things clear i am studying on the side SOC Level 1 and after plan to get CEH certified and applying for masters in germany starting in October but not sure at all to get due to my average bachelor grades. That said i would not like to be wasting my time wether i get accepted and quit or denied as currently between the job and studying i can barely workout but my social life is clapped which i am totally fine with as long as it is worth it.

So experts of the field enlighten me <3, Thank you
