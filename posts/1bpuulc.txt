Are there any highly accepted certs instead of sec+ and net+ that are “ good for life”.

COMMENT TEXT: Linux+ and Project+ still are, I think. Mine haven't been revoked yet anyway, but my A+, Net+ and Sec+ got switched to the CE thing, and I refuse to pay them money every 2 years to maintain what are essentially worthless certs so those got revoked.

COMMENT TEXT: Absolutely. A+ will get you the help desk job. Security+, network+, server+ and cloud+ are all valuable in IT, not just cybersecurity. Not sure what you mean by good for life though, like not having to retest? I don't think that's an option with the CompTIA certs, could be mistaken.
