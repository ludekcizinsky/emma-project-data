POST ID: 1iiwj83 / POST TITLE: Megathread: Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk, and US Cybersecurity Policy Changes
====================================================================================================
This thread is dedicated to discussing the actions of Department of Government Efficiency, Elon Musk‚Äôs role, and the cybersecurity-related policies introduced by the new US administration. Per our rules, we try to congregate threads on large topics into one place so it doesn't overtake the subreddit on those discussions (see CrowdStrike breach last year). All new threads on this topic will be removed and redirected here.

**Stay On-Topic: Cybersecurity First**

Discussions in this thread should remain focused on cybersecurity. This includes:

* The impact of new policies on government and enterprise cybersecurity.
* Potential risks or benefits to critical infrastructure security.
* Changes in federal cybersecurity funding, compliance, and regulation.
* The role of private sector figures like Elon Musk in shaping government security policy.

**Political Debates Belong Elsewhere**

We understand that government policy is political by nature, but this subreddit is not the place for general political discussions. If you wish to discuss broader political implications, consider posting in:

* [r/politics](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/) ‚Äì General U.S. political discussions

2. Just cause the chief of staff days do it doesn't mean he doesn't answer to the oversight committee.

3. He has no authority to be firing long-standing personnel because they tell him no. 

4. This is a deep security issue which pisses on the hard work or everyone who has a clearance or strives to get one. Rich man did it through proxy.

5. From a security stand point, someone who hasn't been vetted thru a background check should not be even allowed to walk into these buildings.

COMMENT TEXT: Article this morning (Thurs Feb 6th) from the Washington Post: "[Musk‚Äôs DOGE agents access sensitive personnel data, alarming security officials](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/06/elon-musk-doge-access-personnel-data-opm-security/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzM4ODE4MDAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzQwMjAwMzk5LCJpYXQiOjE3Mzg4MTgwMDAsImp0aSI6IjMzY2FjZGU4LTk2YzUtNDMwNy1hYzhkLTU4NDE2NDE5NmY2YyIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9uYXRpb25hbC1zZWN1cml0eS8yMDI1LzAyLzA2L2Vsb24tbXVzay1kb2dlLWFjY2Vzcy1wZXJzb25uZWwtZGF0YS1vcG0tc2VjdXJpdHkvIn0.nWJSbAT-3T8RS0msHLffPMldiE4oia6wMlED6HyqDdk)"

**OPM:**

>Records obtained by The Post show that several members of Musk‚Äôs DOGE team ‚Äî some of whom are in their early 20s and come from positions at his private companies ‚Äî were given ‚Äúadministrative‚Äù access to OPM computer systems within days of Trump‚Äôs inauguration last month. That gives them sweeping authority to install and modify software on government-supplied equipment and, according to two OPM officials, to alter internal documentation of their own activities. \[...\]

**Treasury:**

>A former U.S. security official said DOGE‚Äôs access to Treasury‚Äôs payment system is alarming, describing it as a comprehensive map to U.S. expenditures encompassing highly classified programs and purposes.\[...\]Funding ‚Äúfor everything the U.S. government does from food stamps to paying assets \[overseas\] originates at Treasury,‚Äù the former security official said. ‚ÄúWe have a whole bunch of classified relationships with U.S. businesses‚Äù under contract with U.S. intelligence agencies. The payment system ‚Äúis a road map‚Äù to U.S. secrets coveted by foreign intelligence services.

**Threat assessments:**

>Marcus Hutchins, a cybersecurity expert who stopped the 2017¬†[WannaCry ransomware](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-set-to-declare-north-korea-carried-out-massive-wannacry-cyber-attack/2017/12/18/509deb1c-e446-11e7-a65d-1ac0fd7f097e_story.html)¬†worm attributed to North Korea, said the risks would multiply with every new user and new machine plugged in at OPM.

>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs highly likely they‚Äôre improperly accessing, transferring and storing highly sensitive data outside of the environments it was intended to be contained within,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf I were a nation like China, Russia or Iran, I‚Äôd be having a field day with a bunch of college kids running around with sensitive federal government data on unencrypted hard drives.‚Äù \[...\]

>A former senior U.S. security official said foreign adversaries see the disruption caused by DOGE as an opportunity.

>‚ÄúIf I were the Russians or Chinese or Iranians and I saw this DOGE operation getting formed, I would be seeding people into this operation like crazy,‚Äù the former official said. ‚ÄúEither people they‚Äôve already seeded into these companies or people they can recruit quickly and put forward. I can‚Äôt believe the DOGE operation was itself carefully vetting everybody prepared to work for it.‚Äù

COMMENT TEXT: This Megathread seems to have very effectively squashed what were active discussions on the specifics of each of the threads that have been locked. 

What few new comments have been posted here, have been low relevance and/or missing/overlooking the most important information from the now locked threads

Given how little direct coverage or discussion I'm seeing among the most visible news sites and other subreddits of the aspects of these stories specifically related to direct access to codebases, the connection of unsecured/unvetted hardware, and the other general cybersecurity related matters. impacted by these stories, its especially disappointing to see it stamped out so thoroughly here. 

The body of this megathread absolutely nothing pertinent to these developing stories aside from the first sentence. There are no links to the articles from the original, now locked posts. Despite what the OP states, every time I've visited this page today the default sorting has been set to 'Best.'

Frankly this comes across as either being the result of one or more of the mods failing to grasp the significant downstream effects these events will or could have on the rest of the sector and economy at large, or that one or more of the mods has a political bias in favor of the current administration and wishes to see information that casts them in a critical light suppressed. I am not asserting that either of these are the case, just that the choice to lock the other threads in favor of a poorly implemented megathread create the appearance that one of these is the case. 

I'm certainly sympathetic to a desire to not have politics invade every other space in the society/culture, but unfortunately sometimes politics inserts itself into spaces it wasn't invited into. If the purpose of this megathread was to consolidate and enrich the conversation around these stories by combining them into a single cohesive conversation it has failed at that objective; if the purpose of this megathread was to stifle conversation and bury relevant information it has been thoroughly successful.

COMMENT TEXT: A certain foreign government is happy with what Elon and Trump are doing with DOGE. This foreign government helped to elect trump during his first term and its proven in election interference. I think the firing of key CISA leaders and release of Silk Road founder along with other things is leading the USA on a downhill trajectory of destroying the country from within. Releasing him shows the world that the US is open for cybercrime and there won't be punishment. This effectively undoes years of work by the FBI and other departments that work hard to find these people,  put a case together and arrest these criminals.

 Cybersecurity is important for the FBI and other departments in the government but now DOGE along with Trump and Elon is destroying the important work done by these the hard working federal employees. USAID being de funded is just the beginning. 

RIP USA

In the past, foreign policy regarding the Gaza region has spurred protests across the country.¬† While DHS is aware that more protests may arise in the coming days, **TSA is not tracking current information regarding the planning of violent protests in reaction to these comments, or other threats at this time, to include threats to the transportation sector.**"

So, I would be...cautious about flying, since this reads to me there will be zero extra security protocols around, say, some Hamas-friendly person trying to hijack or blow up an airplane. At least there is no historical precedence of Middle Eastern-associated people blowing up airplane or hijacking them due to US policies! /s

COMMENT TEXT: 
Trust me when I say up front that I could just be falling for confirmation bias. 

I'm a network security engineer, and whilst I know enough to where it sounds plausible, I'm certainly not the expert. (Oh, how many app developers do I have to hand hold and smack for doing something silly.)

 Part of my exposure is troubleshooting many issues to prove it's not the network. So I have a general idea of the entire stack at play these days, but certainly no grasp on a deep understanding of firmware software/pcb design

I was hoping you fine folks could read through my findings and give me some feedback. Yes, I know this is an AI list, but let's just act like it's not and take it at face value - what I've laid out has: motive, capability, means.

 The linkage here are some curious questions from a stackoverflow user named "ethan" who asked enough interesting related questions to give a pretty clear method of election interference (same Ethan who developed ballotproof with doge?) 

So we have someone on stack overflow asking questions about doing something that could rig an election (with interesting timing on those posts mind you (2018 question could explain the vote anomaly every n votes, 2024 questions around storing data on ram) a doge employee with xai ties (hackathon) named Ethan who has experience in AI/election software.. circumstantial sure, but the least we could do is rule it out?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Verify2024/s/sq1aF1uaFX 

It also literally fits with all these "little secrets" every republican keeps talking about "whatever that rocket scientist did"

I could be setting myself up for redicule here, but the subs and people (even in real life) have been really receptive to this (again, confirmation bias). 

Please share your thoughts if you could

COMMENT TEXT: I thought I'd share this comment made by someone on Facebook. Note they are a fan of Trump and well Elon. Their thinking is that Elons not really hacking or gaining information from the treasury that's top secret or secretive. They used a comparison to their dentist in that their dentist has what they listed out to be some PII. There is definitely a learning curve here of what a person gives to some entity vs an entity that has specific data because that's their business. For example the social security department at the fed has all SS#s because that's their business. The data classification is set to protect the general American. We all I'd think know that in this group. To this person, what they didn't understand is that they gave the dentist or a bank their own PII because they wanted a service from that entity. Sure that entity now has your PII, but it's of your own fruition. Elon, or Doge isn't someone I went to and said hey I need this and here is my information. To me that's a complete different story. To gain access to data that people didnt want you to have requires you to have some form of training on how to work with that data as well as possible certifications. Just thought I'd throw this out there. Note that my thinking is irrelevant if it's Elon or Big Bird for that matter.

COMMENT TEXT: Recent developments involving the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, have raised significant concerns regarding U.S. cybersecurity policies. Reports indicate that agents associated with Musk have accessed highly restricted government records on millions of federal employees maintained by the Office of Personnel Management, including sensitive information from the Treasury and State Departments.

Experts have expressed alarm over these actions, noting that Musk's takeover of key government systems appears to disregard decades of established laws, regulations, and procedures designed to protect sensitive information.

COMMENT TEXT:    "[...] a lesson for DOGE to remember is that efficiency is not just about cutting. Investing in well-run programs can save taxpayer money. One great example within GSA is another TTS program: the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP), which offers a streamlined process to certify that cloud software is secure before it is purchased by government agencies.

   Prior to FedRAMP, each agency did this type of analysis on its own, which led to inefficient duplication and inconsistent standards. FedRAMP makes it easier for the government to operate and purchase useful technology. Eliminating it would lead to more bureaucracy in the long run. 

   FedRAMP‚Äôs greatest challenge is that it lacks the capacity to process all¬†companies seeking certification, so investing here could increase competition and ultimately result in lower prices across the government"

COMMENT TEXT: I think FedRAMP survives for a few reasons:

1. It's already a law, which in the long run makes it harder to change/remove (in theory).

2. It's already understaffed and had been decently directionless for years before Pete was hired.

3. The proposed [fee schedulle](https://www.fedramp.gov/2024-12-20-exploring-new-ways-to-scale-fedramp/) to help scale FedRAMP should alleviate the staffing concerns and it will show it's a revenue generator. Musk et al appreciate that at some level

4. Every agency that still wants cloud still intends to use it (see point #1)

That all said, I'm sure it will not be without it's challenges. I don't anticipate much to change in the broader sense of how it operates. I am concerned about overall brain drain inside the GSA, but I think point #3 can alleviate that with contractors. Meanwhile, the Administration's own approach to tech can be politely described as stagnant at best. They've gutted [CISA](https://therecord.media/trump-dhs-removal-private-sector-members-advisory-boards), Trump has [revoked](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/trump-revokes-biden-executive-order-addressing-ai-risks-2025-01-21/) EO's on AI, the FedRAMP's [Emerging Tech](https://www.fedramp.gov/updates/et-framework/) pilot was killed as well. 

Trump did issue an [EO on AI](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/removing-barriers-to-american-leadership-in-artificial-intelligence/), but it's hilariously vague and doesn't seem to target any specific goal or outcome beyond "sustain and enhance America‚Äôs global AI dominance". But even still, to me that doesn't impact FedRAMP or acquisition. 

Ultimately, if Pete can get CSP-revenue and use that in an equitable and transparent manner, I think FedRAMP should be able to flourish inside it's swimlane.

COMMENT TEXT: I can speak from the gov't side.  A major software was applying for FedRamp approval and had 2 dedicated staff just to help them navigate all the compliance requirements and help establish "OK this is what you'll do, this is what the gov't will do, and here's the shared responsibilities".  I was one of these staff members.  We just crunched away at excel mostly.

I thought it was crazy we had to do anything.  We were the agency trying to use it.  I just kind of assumed they'd go through it with FedRamp directly, then we'd get to use it.  Like a 3rd party risk management team approving software for use in an organization.

COMMENT TEXT: A key question will be what happens to Noblis contract and funding. Remember that the GSA office itself is under a dozen (used to be a handful, not sure of it today). Noblis is the day-to-day for so much of what FedRAMP does. And it's a multi-year many-millions contract. Cut that in half (some news is reporting that the GSA targets are for 50% reductions) and there will be massive slowdowns from even what we have today. On the other hand they're super-likely to really like the new CSP-funded ideas. Off-topic, but I find it ironic that StateRAMP 100% copied FedRAMP at the beginning, but now FedRAMP might copy StateRAMP's funding model.

COMMENT TEXT: 1.  You have proof that he's not cleared for what he's doing?  Do you know exactly what data the people are looking at, or are they merely a portal to people with clearances are reviewing the data?    
2.  These agencies haven't been answering to anyone, that's the issue.  Democrats and Republicans alike have been asking questions, and are stonewalled.  "I don't know.  I didn't bring that information with me.  I have to get clearance from the agency's lawyer before answering that.  I'll have to get back to you on that."  And to be honest, neither party seems to be particularly concerned with the way money is spent, AS LONG AS it's spent on the agenda of that particular party.  
3.  He has every authority to fire certain people.  If a government agency has people that "can't" be fired, that's an issue in and of itself.  Quite frankly there are some seriously useless people in the government that need to be fired, and those that work hard and do their job need to be appreciated.  
4.  The security issues that preceded this is what caused this.  (See Item #2).  If these agencies had been transparent, if these agencies had actually been doing what they were intended to do, this wouldn't be happening.    
5.  I'll agree and disagree.  There are levels of trust that need to be established.  At the same time we've seen over and over where people who have clearances have flat our lied.  I also believe that some of this information is "classified" not because it contains some secrets that may threaten the life of some agent overseas, but is done so that policies which are disagreeable to a large portion of the country are kept hidden.

It seems everyone is concerned about WHO is looking through the data, but there isn't any concern over what is being found.

"Hey Mister, someone is robbing your house!"

"Who are you?"

"Nobody important, I just wanted to let you know there are people stealing your valuables!" (points to people carrying jewelry and safes out to their truck)

"Yeah, but why are you looking here?  Who told you that you could do that?"

"Aren't you concerned about everything you have being stolen?"

Apparently because he expressed racist views on an old inactive social media account. But the timing... that's weird af.

Edit: And just earlier today a letter from two congressmembers addressed to the Treasury Secretary about their concerns regarding access to the payment system went public + details of a forced confrontation about it: https://talkingpointsmemo.com/where-things-stand/dems-suggest-they-got-johnson-to-commit-to-hearing-on-elons-treasury-break-in

> Both the Washington Times and Politico reported yesterday on what they described as a confrontation between [Reps. Judy Chu (D-CA), Gwen Moore (D-WI) and House Speaker Mike Johnson]. The Democrats reportedly entered the speaker‚Äôs office shortly after Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent arrived for a meeting with Johnson. Bessent was there to discuss tax policy-related items with Johnson and House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith (R-MO).

>Chu and Moore reportedly asked Johnson about Bessent gifting Musk and his DOGE bros unprecedented access to a sensitive payment system. Bessent has maintained that Musk and his cronies are restricted to ‚Äúread only‚Äù access, but it‚Äôs unclear whether this term really captures what is going on: ‚Äúread only‚Äù or not, TPM has reported that the DOGE guys (one of whom just resigned over past racist posts) have apparently been adding new code to the system.

That Board is trying to hold the House Speaker accountable to meet in a hearing next week to talk about this further.

But then suddenly today one of those programmers "resigns"?

I'm not one for conspiracy theories but you can't really ignore the timing around all of this either.

COMMENT TEXT: Well said and documented, appreciate it.

I‚Äôve been thinking the same thing, based on them adding their own hardware its likely they‚Äôre operating their personal laptops or otherwise non-compliant to government standards and very likely have sensitive data on their with no proper EDR or monitoring. I would venture these would be easy targets to a sufficiently sophisticated actor. Not even to mention if there‚Äôs an attacker with a foothold in the environment already, very good chance they‚Äôre pivoting to these workstations/servers with data flowing in. 

Again, these are all just my professional opinions and also assuming, no true facts just thinking what I‚Äôd be doing if I were an adversary tracking these activities. Will be very interesting.

COMMENT TEXT: I literally used this same analogy the other day!   
  
Also, as a sysadmin, I don‚Äôt even have direct access to our domain controllers at work due to the principle of separation of duties. While I have full control over the physical infrastructure that hosts them, I am restricted from accessing the DCs themselves. This separation of power exists for a reason‚Äîto prevent any single individual from having unchecked control over critical systems. If such security measures are necessary for internal IT environments, why should Elon Musk‚Äîor any private entity‚Äîbe granted access to sensitive Social Security data without similar safeguards?

COMMENT TEXT: Which is good until you stumble on the supreme court decision.  Trump can violate any law he wants "in the performance of his duties".  So, illegally giving access in direct violation of laws or the constitution?  Doesn't matter in the slightest, because he's performing his...  Whatever he wants to phrase it as.  I'd use pejorative terms myself, but that probably will get this removed.

Is it unconstitutional?  Darn good question which will keep his hand-picked lawyers (including the full weight of a newly partisan justice department) busy for several years...  At least through 2026, and more than likely through 2028.  Right now, there is nothing effectively stopping Trump from giving access to anything except "rules" set up by agencies that are quickly being either removed or at the least depopulated.

I'm scared, honestly.  He is doing his best to remove all impediments to (effectively) imperial power, and yet his fans are still cheering him on.  As far as they're concerned (you can see in the threads on here) Musk is "auditing" the software (which is why they needed to lock all other admins out and install software that is not able to be looked at) or "reducing government waste" by directly eliminating funding for whatever agencies they feel like.  Congress?  Half of them are "heck yeah!", one quarter is "well, guess we'll go along", most of the rest are the ones protesting - a week or two too late.

Finally, getting back to cybersecurity, the world is now very aware that they've eliminated multiple groups that were working on cybersecurity, and investigating foreign access to US systems.  If that isn't a shout for them to do what they feel like, I don't know what is.

COMMENT TEXT: Setting aside for a moment the fact that the Administration appears to still be failing to comply with the order issued last week about pausing the freeze of funds, the specific language in the order is,

>  
The Defendants will not provide access to any payment record or payment system of records maintained by or within the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, except that the Defendants may provide access to any of the following people:   
  
\[...\]  
  
Mr. Marko Elez, a Special Government Employee in the Department of the Treasury, as needed for the performance of his duties, provided that such access to payment records will be "read only";

  
'payment system of records' is a little kludgy to me, but could conceivably be the appropriate language to describe the Payment Automation Manager (PAM) and Secure Payment System (SPS), however I find the specific mention of 'read only' in relation to, "payment records," and only to "payment records," concerning. That seems like more than enough vagueness to allow someone at DOJ or Treasury, if sufficiently motivated, to find room to continue to grant Mr. Elez access to the codebase of the PAM or SPS, as presumably both of those systems primarily serve to *create* records, rather than store or view them.

COMMENT TEXT: Ok, @LeButter_. Due to 2 previous executive orders. 1 signed by Obama and the other by Clinton. A Clearance is not a skeleton key to access any government information system.

Stay with me now.

EO 12968

EO 13467.

 Both outline that a clearance has to be issued by the agency. We don't have a centralized agency nor a single point of entry to be a skeleton key for everything. If you have a Clearance because you work for DOGE. cool guess what you need a clearance from the DOD to access their information systems. You can pass a top secret for the agriculture department but be barred from access to DOD. there are requirements and parameters for access for people to do so. Please read the orders and don't try to interpret the information to fit your perception or preconceived bias. Read as is and take it as is. It's been a few days and even now you can see the cracks. All of their offers are not legal to federal employees. They are having their access that they never should have had revoked. And the only thing they can do is have the VP hop on Twitter and complain that judges are not allowed to use their legally correct power to check all this unlawful movement in government.

COMMENT TEXT: Right and the fact is they have not done so. But yet he is running thru these programs with no oversight or call for review. Missiles and rockets tops secret clearance doesn't translate to DOT, FAA, DOD. and he would need to receive a clearance from each and every department he has been raiding like a pirate. He is essentially running rampant. You can defend and say he has a clearance. Cool most people who serve in the military have a clearance but that clearance needs to be adhered to and upheld by the issuing agency.

The point is, that through the DoD's own research, few are actually NIST 800-171 compliant.¬†

CMMC does 1 thing that's different, in the most important way. ¬†

It forces NIST 800-171, self reported, "compliance", to be audited by a third party.¬†

it's already been pushed through, and finalized.¬†

re: Price gouging, not sure exactly what you're referencing here, buy yes, I believe that American digital primes are stifling American innovation with licensing gouging.¬†

Microsoft, Google, Ansys, Siemens, Palo Alto, Crowdstrike, Sentinel One, pick a list of REQUIRED "commercial" tools to run a defense industrial based engineering program, as a business enterprise, that has to be profitable...¬†

Swap 'em out, switch em around, and after the onslaught of Fedramp approved tool's, licensing costs, there's no budget left for small businesses to do litetally dick, but lie about their security posture, and pretend they're doing things right, because they have an actual business to run.¬†

The problem isn't that the regulation is fiscally impossible, the problem is, we traded our "no monopolies" stance on things like Microsoft in the commercial space, to, but it's fine if you do it in the Government space, and they have.¬†

We have an Oligarchy of mafia level digital overlords, and these are real people.¬†

I had the CEO of Ansys drop an 800k license on the table, with the statement, "we know you can't complete your project without us"...¬†

like... the fuck, is this why you brought 8 of your tech bros to this meeting?¬†

The fact that engineering tools like Teamcenter exists, analogous to Solidworks, Creo, et all, is an illusion of choice.¬†

In all of these verticals, the digital lockin is near instant.¬†

So instead of a clear monopoly, we just have a thousand tiny monopolies, and they're economically defeating the US's physical defense sector.¬†

"One does not simply rip out the engineering tool, that your entire engineering team is collaborating on an active project around.

But I can arbitrarily increase the licensing cost by $500,000 because fuck you".¬†

USAID primarily supplied food for the starving and disaster hit, and essential medicines responsible for preventing the next COVID from sweeping the world. Which lowers illegal immigration, and lowers health risk to Americans.

DOGE isn't protecting the US government from shady things. They've specifically attacked every department that has been investigating one of Musk's companies for being shady.

COMMENT TEXT: Yes. Thank you. I saw that earlier. There was a rename of the US Digital Service that was created under President Obama, but the executive order only permits access to unclassified information and systems (https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/establishing-and-implementing-the-presidents-department-of-government-efficiency/). They are clearly doing far more than that. This is the issue more than the org itself.

I could be incorrect, but I don't think USDS/DOGE sits at the same level as DOE, DOD, etc. I'm not sure where the current employees performing actions on the servers for the US Treasury, VA, etc., sit in the org chart either. Like, I don't think they have security clearances or normal GS-[number] statuses.

Ordinarily, a Secretary of Energy/Defense, etc. would have a Senate confirmation process to determine fitness. I don't think that happened for Elon Musk.

COMMENT TEXT: Except that for >some< companies, who have been doing this since before CMMC was a thing, ones that have been dealing with ITAR regulations this whole time, have been taking steps to be secure all along.

Most manufacturers need to be ISO and/ or AS9100 compliant to get government work. Back in 2010, when CMMC/(edit CUI) was first thought of, both of those entities didn‚Äôt say a word about cybersecurity. Now both have wording that is similar to CMMC level 1. 

I agree, when this started, a lot of people weren‚Äôt taking care of CUI. It sucks being one of those companies that has been doing it all along, but now we gotta pay 50-100k every 3 years for someone to say, ‚Äúoh yea, they keep data safe.‚Äù

Read that again. $50-$100k. Just for cybersecurity. Add $8-$10k EACH for ISO, AS9100, NADCAP, $20k for yearly audits if you provide a 401k‚Ä¶not to mention IRS, ICE‚Ä¶‚Äùsupply and demand‚Äù‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a BS excuse too because you don‚Äôt have a lot to choose from when getting a AS9100 auditor either!

CMMC is just an assessment, not even an audit. Plus, NIST 800-171/172 already had a DoD audit process in place for companies that were deemed to be of higher National Security. If they were going to do anything, the easiest solution all along was just open up the DoD audits of NIST 171-172 to be performed by 3rd parties. 

I agree on licensing and the whole Fedramp thing too.

That you've pointed out something smart with your sophistry here? We still have an election! Yay! A meaningless one if the person who wins isn't seated.

How about this: Trump issues an EO, which he claims can now override the Constitution (see birthright citizenship eo) and acts of Congress stating that he dissolves Congress. What then? Trump can even point to the Const. Art 2 gives POTUS the power to adjourn Congress. What if he does that and it just NEVER comes back? After all, he now controls the military, thinks he can make law via EO, and is trying to seize the treasury. What's the point of Congress if you have all the power?

These are not farfetched hypotheticals. These are very real consequences with the rule of law collapses and our Constitution is rendered meaningless.

COMMENT TEXT: I understand that you've embarrassed yourself elsewhere in this post but there's really no reason bring your poor attitude to our exchange.


So to cut right to answer being sought - the federal government has no direct oversight or management of state-run elections. While Trump and his administration present a real threat to US democracy, it's institutions, and the wellbeing of the American public, the hypotheticals you've crafted are quite ignorant and clearly lacking any constructive criticism.



Again, in your Omar example, Republicans can't refuse to seat her - that's not a power they have because, again, the state-led effort determines the results. This is an elected seat of public office - not a nomination that requires a hearing/Congressional approval.



And Trump is going to dissolve Congress? I think Republicans will have plenty to say about that considering they wouldn't want to lose power, especially to someone so fickle and moronic.



Now why don't you scurry off to whatever subs you frequented before you discovered r/cybersecurity last week.
