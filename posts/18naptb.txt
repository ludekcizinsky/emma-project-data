POST ID: 18naptb / POST TITLE: At what point do I start looking for bugs?
====================================================================================================
I've just gotten into the ethical hacking field, and I've been learning with portswigger academy, hack the box, HackerOne's capture the flag, etc.

I've finished up portswigger's course on SQLi, and I'm wondering if I should start looking for SQLi bugs, keep learning about other vulnerabilities, or something in between?
