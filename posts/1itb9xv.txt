====================================================================================================
Hey, so I just started a cybersecurity program and saw there were a few bundles on Humble Bundle that caught my eye, and I was wondering if they would be at all worth it. I am pretty fresh into school, like less than a month, but am eager to learn. These bundles, I believe, would be great to help maybe learn a little extra and help with certs. Are any of these three worth it?
