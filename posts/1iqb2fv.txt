POST ID: 1iqb2fv / POST TITLE: If it’s your data, why don’t you own it?
====================================================================================================
Every search, every purchase, every late-night scroll—companies track it, store it, and sell it for billions. AI uses your writing to created and learn from. But us? We don’t see a dime. It’s not just about money, though. It’s about control. At some point, we all just accepted that using the internet means handing over our information by default. But who decided that? And why wasn’t it us?  

Imagine if things worked differently. If every piece of data you created was something you actually owned. If you could decide who sees it, who profits from it, or whether it gets locked away entirely. If your digital identity wasn’t scattered across platforms you don’t control but was something you actually held in your hands. Would the internet look the same?  

The real question is, why isn’t it already this way? If data is the most valuable asset of the digital world, why is ownership reserved for corporations instead of the people actually generating it? Maybe it’s time to stop accepting the way things are and start asking why they aren’t different.
