If your friend uses their Wi-Fi network to access sensitive information such as online banking or credit card accounts, a hacker could potentially intercept this information and steal it.
  

### Conduct illegal activities:
A hacker could use your friend's Wi-Fi network to carry out illegal activities such as downloading copyrighted material or launching attacks on other computers.
  

### Spread malware:
The hacker could use your friend's Wi-Fi network to spread malware to other devices connected to the network, or to other networks.
  
 
### Use up bandwidth:
The hacker could use up a significant amount of bandwidth, slowing down the network for your friend and other users.
