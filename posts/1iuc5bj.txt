POST ID: 1iuc5bj / POST TITLE: Looking for a company for Cyber Security Training
====================================================================================================
Hey all, a while back now i remember i found a cyber security training company that you could purchase a portable server of sorts that you could plug in into your enviroment and run simulations base on real world breaches . It would even gamify it and provide a cool training program for IT employees to enhance cybersecurity skills and awareness. 

  
I just cant seem to find it , not sure if they are no longer in buisiness or i dreamed it up. Anyone able to provide some insight or recommendations?
