====================================================================================================
Hello, there.  


I recently received a text message from "my bank," linking to a website (yes, I opened it in a sandbox) asking to 'confirm changes to my account." This was clearly a phishing scam. My quandary is this: I want to warn others, and let them know to notify the right agencies if they fell victim, but the bank, themselves seem unconcerned by this. "We'll put in a note, but we don't handle this stuff..."  


I'd like to find out if this is a likely data breach, or if it's just a blanket text sent to loads of folks in my area. It is a regional bank, and not the most common in the area, so that makes me wonder. If it can be substantiated that it is a data breach, the bank can be held accountable and made to inform their customers, to protect the maximum number of people possible.  


My next question is: I did a significant amount of surface level investigation. Is it possible in all of that to see how the data is being stored (text file, SQL, etc), and/or where it's being exported? I looked at the 'method' and it seems like if it's 'post,' it's not possible to suss that out.  


Finally, do domain registrars really care at all about abuse? Is it worth reporting? Can I even trust the whois lookup to give me an accurate registrar? The whois and the tracert sent me to two different registrars, so I just don't know where to go to report it.  


If the bank doesn't care, and the domain registrars don't care (the website is still up, despite being reported days ago - though it is a holiday, I suppose), what can be done? Is awareness all there is? I want to protect my community, but I'm at a loss, and this website is still operating.
