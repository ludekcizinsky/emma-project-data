POST ID: 1ireqrq / POST TITLE: Security Budget of a Company
====================================================================================================
What do you think the average security budget of a company would be? Do you think it changes depending on how big or small the company is, or how regulated it is? Iâ€™m guessing it might fall somewhere around 8-10% of the overall budget.
