POST ID: 1isw1g9 / POST TITLE: What should be learnt about OS for Cybersecurity?
====================================================================================================
I'm working on my skills towards getting into Cybersecurity roles and a lot of them ask for knowledge of Linux and Windows OS. I want to know what exactly should I be learning in that? What is expected for an entry level Cybersecurity engineer to know? 
P.S. Any learning material/methods will be good
