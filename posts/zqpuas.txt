====================================================================================================
Hi guys,

Can someone recommend me a good gift for a pentester?

I was looking at TryHackMe vouchers, but I believe the challenges are too basic as this person already has lot's of experience in this field.

For myself I got a Flipper Zero :) lol :) but I'm more into hardware and this person is more into software/web apps.

Thank you so much!

COMMENT TEXT: Even if they're not that much into hardware, that flipper would be an amazing gift to anybody that is in this space. ;) Especially because those are super tough to get your hands on right now - or so that's what I have heard.
