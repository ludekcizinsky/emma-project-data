POST ID: 1iokf9d / POST TITLE: IT-ISAC releases 2024 ransomware landscape report
====================================================================================================
This week IT-ISAC released their [ransomware landscape report](https://www.it-isac.org/_files/ugd/473ff0_b98aab4f18ef496585ffd92cad7daada.pdf) (covers more than just the IT sector), and I found the following interesting callouts. There are some other interesting bits in there as well like an increase in abuse of AI.


**Most targeted industry:** Critical Manufacturing (733 attacks, 20% of total incidents).

**Most targeted country (not surprising):** United States (1,984 attacks, 57% of all incidents worldwide).

**Largest spike:** Q3 2024 saw an 85% increase in attacks over the previous quarter, attributed to improved tracking methods.

**End-of-year surge:** Q4 had 1,514 ransomware attacks, a 62% increase from Q3, likely due to holiday season vulnerabilities.

RansomHub emerged as the most dominant group, surpassing LockBit due to its high affiliate payouts (90%) and tactics like social engineering and SIM swapping.

**Common attack vectors:**

* 42% - Exploiting known vulnerabilities.
* 28.5% - Phishing.
* 29.5% - Other (RDP compromise, social engineering, MFA fatigue attacks).
