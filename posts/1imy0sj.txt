Hey everyone, I recently passed the PJPT exam by TCM, and I also earned the PORP certification before. I'm planning to take the PNPT exam in the future, so I was wondering which parts of the PEH course I should focus on—aside from the AD section, as I’ve already memorized and fully understood it.
Thanks 🙏🏼
