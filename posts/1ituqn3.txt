POST ID: 1ituqn3 / POST TITLE: Hardware firewall for electronic patient record?
====================================================================================================
Hello there, 

I'm in a psychotherapeutic practice in Germany, and we're debating whether to invest in a dedicated hardware firewallâ€”especially with the electronic patient record (ePA) on the horizon. We connect to the Telematics system via a software-based link to a data center called RISE TIaaS Client, not through a local connector. Would a hardware firewall offer substantial benefits over standard router or software solutions, particularly for protecting sensitive patient data? Any experiences or insights would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!
