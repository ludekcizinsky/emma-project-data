POST ID: 1cm5uwr / POST TITLE: Am I on the right path?
====================================================================================================
So I am a newbie to the world of ethical hacking and cybersecurity. I am a first year student and this is the path I'm following. 
I am learning from portswigger labs web security academy for the pentest skills, and for networking skills I have opted a course for cisco certified network associate certification course on udemy by david bombal.
I have good enough experience on linux like ububtu, and recently shifted to kali coz..... its kali.

And a little background about my tech skills.
I have good knowledge about web development with frameworks like django and flask. And in dbms I know and have used mysql.

So just would like to know if I'm on right path if I wanna become a good ethical hacker/cybersecurity person. 


Am I on the right path?

Thanks!
