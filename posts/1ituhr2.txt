POST ID: 1ituhr2 / POST TITLE: Really struggling
====================================================================================================
Second semester in cyber and I feel like I am struggling a lot. Most of my time goes into troubleshooting rather than smoothly going on with my assignments. I am fucking frustration. Sometimes issues with a workstation not connecting to server and other times server not receiving internet.

Like i am always troubleshooting. But this is something i want to do, i get tired but don’t feel like giving up. 

Please tell me if you guys have something i can get help from. Any suggestions or advice.

Welcome to IT. 

If you don't like the basics of tech work, you are not going to be happy even after school and started working.

COMMENT TEXT: Bad news: you’ll be doing this forever. I sometimes go into my work thinking that nothing ever works right and it sucks. Can really get me frustrated just like you.

Good news: you get better at it. It’s not easier, but you deal with it better.

Keep it up, remember why you’re interested. Remember that you’re young and have plenty of time to pivot, but don’t quit the career over some DNS issues.

Good luck man!

COMMENT TEXT: Everyone's probably going to jump on the "it's part of the job" bandwagon, and they are absolutely right. But you do get better at debugging problems as time goes on. The best advice is when you are frustrated step away from your keyboard and do something to take your mind off the problem for 30 mins or so. I doom scroll Instagram or watch some mind numbing YouTube. And if you're really stuck, the best debugger is a good night of sleep.

COMMENT TEXT: Look, troubleshooting is a rite of passage! We all have been there! Make sure you're reaching out fellow students. Also, when looking for videos, look for the most current. Like less than 3 months old. Finally, take with your professors. They can make suggestion.

One last thing, find your niche, What you love to do! And dive deep into that rabbit hole! Your first job will not be the one your want but it willl get you to the one you been working on the that rabbit hole! 

Your will also run into the nay sayers. They are everywhere! Thee best thing to do ignore them and learn to dance to your own drummer. When all is said and done, the nay sayers will be standing on the side line wishing they were you!

Welcome to the real world. This is all IT. Fix it until it breaks, repeat. Most of my life is spent troubleshooting problems. Don't let it be emotional. Don't let impostor syndrome cloud your judgement. There is a solution to every problem. If you don't know, ask. There's tons of support on reddit, forums, facebook groups, and even ai platforms. Get used to not knowing everything because you never will. Your job is to find solutions that other people can't. The better you adapt to problems, the more successful you will be.

COMMENT TEXT: I've been in this game since well before Y2K, and I'll tell you three things: 1. Just when you thought you get the hang of something, you will realise that something has changed again. Change is a constant in this game; embrace it and learn to love it (and tolerate it on the days it feels like it's getting too much; next week will be better), otherwise it will chew you up and spit you out over time. 2. Don't focus on learning just the "what", get to understand the "why". Even when things change, understanding *why* things might not work speeds up the search to where you then should look first for changes, and then to figure it out (and learn something new in the process). 3. Avoid shortcuts and go right back down to the very fundamental basics and building blocks. Spend time on really, really, reeeally understanding why the basics work the way they do. If you can explain a basic concept to someone who is not technical so that they understand the principle well enough, then you're halfway there, keep going. Don't just click the mouse, understand what happens under the hood when you click the mouse. Fundamentals do not change that often, they evolve, and keeping up with that is easier than just troubleshooting from scratch all the time, every time.

Good luck. It does get better, but you have to reframe it in your mind before it does. Oh, and make sure you balance work and R&R time, trust me on this one.

COMMENT TEXT: Hello, I am on my last year of my Cyber Security bachelors. Troubleshooting is 90% of the job tbh. Anything you ever work on will rarely work on the first try. It’s the nature of the field. That’s why you go through so many rigorous problem solving gen Ed’s in college. Unfortunately if troubleshooting is really that frustrating for you, IT may not be the field to go into. On the other hand, I also hated it as a freshman but grown to “love” (hate) it. Good luck brother bear.

COMMENT TEXT: Are you struggling in a particular class? Is it hands on or a virtual environment? Do you have a checklist of commands to use that will diagnose the problem? 

Expect for nothing ever goes right. You are learning how to make it right. That’s why there has to be an organized process to fix the issue. I have seen students, and myself, rush through a lab and not follow key steps or use the commands correctly to solve the problem. Use a scalpel, not a hammer.

COMMENT TEXT: I hate troubleshooting crap that does not pertain to the content I’m supposed to be trained on. My entire Masters degree was hands-on and many of the courses would have recommendations for a Linux version and software requirements but nothing ever worked. I would spend silly amounts of my time after work troubleshooting, finding compatible versions and sharing them with my classmates. 

If you’re paying a degree they should provide the lab for you to focus on learning the material; however, it is just a moment, it will pass, keep pushing through and provide them feedback in a respectful manner. Most professors don’t know as much as you think they do and don’t have the time or forethought in creating a better experience for students. Provide solutions for all the problems you are encountering in your feedback and hope they implement them for future classes.

COMMENT TEXT: Been in IT for a while, network security for a few. It’s almost never an issue to deal with tech, as long as it’s not proprietary software or hardware with nill support, but the people who think it’s the firewalls fault. 

I can’t stress enough the importance of the OSI model. Learn what does what at each layer and all the integral parts of a network working WAN & LAN, and troubleshooting will be far easier. Leave the specific parts to the SME’s and work on the theory behind the next step. 

Example, today I troubleshot a webpage not working. Scouted the logs for a few, made a quick test change, and asked to test, same issue. Random thought, let’s put a different (less complicated machine) on the same subnet and try again. Worked.. turns out my firewalls weren’t the issue, but a local host based endpoint protection/detection system.. trust what you know, work on a system, let the people think illogically, and stick to the model. You can’t argue arbitrary information when the entire system is built on a yes or a no. 101001

COMMENT TEXT: I had a similar experince when I started cyber. My PC couldn’t launch instances on AWS. I changed my ISP and tried most of the methods but it didn’t change. My instructor told me to just enjoy the troubleshooting as I may learn smth. It turned out that my PC time was the problem. I changed it to the automatic one that came with the PC and everything started working smoothly. Was able to lauch aws instance easily, deploy honeypot and download softwares that weren’t working before. 

I got the idea to do this after searching the error name on Google. I was using copilot and chatgpt all along without any luck. 

So I understand your frustration firsthand. I will just enjoin you to also fall in love with troubleshooting. Always seek help and if possible run your codes and labs on another PC to confirm it’s not an hardware problem. Goodluck!

COMMENT TEXT: Hey bud, I get what you mean. I am close to taking the ccna exam and working on labs and I've spent a small but decent portion of time troubleshooting the mistakes from the lab creator, when what I want to be studying are the exam topics, not 'what's wrong with the lab". My experience with tech is that I"m often troubleshooting something and it's not the thing I'm trying to work on.

I have learned this: Packet Tracer is simple and convenient, but it often doesn't work the way it should and do not spend any time troubleshooting it if you are sure you're right or being creative with it outside the lab parameters. That's a waste of time with PT, GNS3 and others fine, but not PT.

COMMENT TEXT: Troubleshooting IS learning. Walking through some lab step by step where everything goes smoothly gets you nothing because, in the real world, your projects won't go smoothly. In the future, quickly troubleshooting and fixing issues preventing you from completing your project (deploying a firewall, segmenting a network, etc) is what makes you valuable to an organization. I know it is frustrating right now but if you can slightly change how you look at it, you will grow professionally at a much more rapid pace.

However as someone who has also been on the receiving end of these requirements, there is a lot of room for improvement in specifications. Most issues come from gaps in communication, not technology expertise.

If you are able to, try clarifying ambiguity with the person who wrote the document. If you are unable, try putting it into ChatGPT/Gemini and see if it can help.

That should be the first step.

COMMENT TEXT: I will say putting in the hours is definitely part of the process, and it did take me a while before I could manage my time and force myself to take breaks. Give yourself some more understanding that you are still very new to this so you can't expect yourself to be good at everything right away. The problem of an over active brain on problems definitely doesn't go away. 

Also if you think there's a hint you're a little neurospicy as with a fair amount of people in the cyber community, find coping mechanisms to help prevent the inevitable burnout. Motorbikes/MMA/Climbing/online or board games really help take you off the keyboard and calm down for a few hours a week.

I was a professional programmer for 4 years when I started going to college and I had a lot of the same issues you do, so I assume that's par for the course.  I did vocational training in the military. My field required very high test scores and a special test. We still had a 50% failure rate. There were 2 guys that just "got it", though.

Part of the problem is they start putting you in cyber classes without giving you a solid IT foundation first. The other problem is all that shit should work and not get in the way of the topic of the course.
