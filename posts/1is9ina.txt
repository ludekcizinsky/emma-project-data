# 100+ AWS Keys Found in Public GitHub Repositories!

Hello r/cybersecurity ,

While exploring **GitHub Dorking + TruffleHog**, I discovered a shocking number of exposed AWS keys—some with high privileges! To scale this further, I built [AWS-Key-Hunter](https://github.com/IamLucif3r/AWS-Key-Hunter), an automated tool that hunts leaked AWS keys and sends real-time Discord alerts.

🔍 **Findings**:  
✅ Public repos often leak sensitive credentials.  
✅ TruffleHog has limitations—so I built a better solution.  
✅ Automation helps catch leaks before attackers do.

PS: This was just an experiment for fun.
