POST ID: 17230px / POST TITLE: Suggest WPA2 a wordlist
====================================================================================================
Hi,  
I am trying to crack WPA2 passwords [https://mab.to/t/r7WqkaeW0m5/eu1](https://mab.to/t/r7WqkaeW0m5/eu1) from handshake files with hashcat.   


Tried every possible wordlist I found (starting with rockyou), but nothing was able to get password. For unknown reason [gpuhash.me](https://gpuhash.me) was able to get these passwords within 50 seconds. What wordlist do they use? What wordlists do you use?

COMMENT TEXT: depending on random wordlists, to blindly crack a random wifi network, is futile

research the router brand, the isp it likely uses, etc, many isp now have defaults that are not gonna get cracked in our lifetime
