POST ID: 147qz3x / POST TITLE: Found a hole in web licence managment application - whats now?
====================================================================================================
Hello, i found a really big and easy usable bug in a webapplication which is used to check licence keys for onprem software. The company is not such big, but its hard to say how many bucks its made per month. I imagine the licences that i found are worth around 500k usd (if they are already sold, what i think so). 

The Bug is really easy to use and results in a list of tousends usable keys for this application which needs normaly monthly payed.  I tested a few of them and they send a "licence ok" back if you use it in the application. 

The question is, what should i do with that information? I would say im not a criminal, so i dont like to publish or use it. Is it ethical legit to ask the company for a bug bounty? Or just contact them and tell what is going on? Or just forgot it?

COMMENT TEXT: The ethical thing would be to just let them know there is a bug, what causes it, and provide the proof of what you've found.  The problem with mentioning anything beyond that is that you're telling them you found a verified bug, which means you yourself have exploited it to verify it, so saying anything about compensation could come off as malicious intent.

They could say "Thank you!" and \*possibly\* offer some small monetary thanks, or if they're absolute asshats, they could just gather your info and claim that you hacked them and are now extorting money from them.

The reality of it though, unless you manage to contact someone in IT who actually *gets it*, they're more than likely just going to delete your email... if it even makes it through their spam filter.

Personally, I go option 1, but the initial email is "Is there a direct point of contact in your IT department who I could report a bug on your website to?" and see if they respond.

COMMENT TEXT: i would just tell them , without bringing up money or anything they might give some type or reward, but i highly doubt it if its not on a bug bounty program i done something similar and only gave me credit to use on their website.

COMMENT TEXT: I would see if they have anything resembling a security program or contact. If they don't see if you can report it to google's project. You probably won't get any money, but you won't be accused.
