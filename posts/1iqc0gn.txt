POST ID: 1iqc0gn / POST TITLE: Why do we not encourage use of the FAQ?
====================================================================================================

A lot of people whose time is valuable spend a lot of time crafting high effort responses to low effort questions.

Why is internet culture now such that it is taboo to tell people to read the FAQ and then come back with a novel or interesting question and close the comments?

That's how it was when we all paid for our own storage and bandwidth to host this stuff on Usenet and mailing lists. 

I'll tell you why: This platform (and most others these days) gets paid for engagement and desperately needs content. Although it would better serve the questioners and answerers to have a FAQ addressing the top questions thus minimizing traffic in this sub, that is not in the interest of the people who run this platform.

It also isn't in the interest of people who get an ego boost from admin/moderating the sub so they need the traffic for their fix.

But it's primarily the former. The admin/moderator situation is set up to encourage the free labor to encourage content creation/engagement/ad views.
