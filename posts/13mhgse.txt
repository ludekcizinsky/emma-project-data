Hey guys, 

Check out my Youtube video that shows you how hackers use bettercap to capture traffic and modify them on your local network using a Man in the middle attack terminology.

The main goal of this video is how to secure yourself from these types of attacks which is by using a reputable VPN service that would encrypt all of your data.

Enjoy!

COMMENT TEXT: 1. A VPN would be useless against an mitm attack
2. Your data is already encrypted because you use HTTPS

I fucking hate VPN ads and the misinformation they've spread among the population

COMMENT TEXT: 1. You are mistaken sir. A VPN will be very effective for stopping bettercap MITM. I'm not sure what level you are at currently, but regardless I suggest researching before making such statement disinforming others. 
2. Yes, and No. Please watch the video for more details about this and why a VPN would help stop this type of attack.
3. This is NOT a VPN ad. I didn't even mention a single VPN company in the video. I love sharing and contributing to the community to spread security awareness. Thank you for your feedback though!

COMMENT TEXT: Yeah because pretty much every YouTuber has become a VPN shill, your average person thinks that a VPN is the end all be all to online security. Sure, it can make you more *private* online but it doesnâ€™t really make you that much more secure.
