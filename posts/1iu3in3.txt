====================================================================================================
At the SHIELD 2025 event, it was mentioned that in 2024, India lost over Rs 22,812 crore to cyber fraud. Itâ€™s crazy how cybercriminals are using tools like AI and deepfake technology to pull off scams like phishing, identity theft, and ransomware attacks. Not only does this cause huge financial losses, but it also makes us question the safety of the digital platforms we use every day.

Have you ever faced any scams like these?
