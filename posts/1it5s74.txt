POST ID: 1it5s74 / POST TITLE: MSSP Needs a Centralized Log Management & Threat Detection Solution – Recommendations?
====================================================================================================
Hello Reddit!!!

I work for an MSSP, and we currently use:

* RMM & Security: NinjaRMM, SentinelOne Complete + Vigilance or Huntress + Defender
* Identity & SSO: All clients use Entra ID for authentication and SSO
* Firewall & Network: Palo Alto as our firewall, mainly Cisco for networking devices
* Backup & Storage: Veeam for backups, Wasabi for storage
* Password Management: We resell Bitwarden
* Vulnerability Scanning: Nessus for network discovery, SentinelOne for endpoints (but we don’t have a dedicated product for this yet)
* Productivity: Office 365 Business Premium, but we also use other Microsoft packages like E3 (we are a Microsoft partner)

I'm looking for a solution that can aggregate logs from all the vendors we use (SentinelOne, Huntress, Palo Alto, Entra ID, Veeam, etc.) and also ingest network device logs (mostly Cisco).  
I’d like to define alerting rules, ideally with threat hunting capabilities to detect suspicious activity or indicators of compromise.

Is there a tool that can achieve this?
