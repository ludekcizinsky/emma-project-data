====================================================================================================
I am a noob here, I started ethical hacking yesterday, so please help me. I am using hashcat bruteforce attack on my generated hash.

if i use ?l?s?d 
does it mean that the special character will be tried only on second place and digits will be tried only on third place??

What if I only know that there is only one special character exist in the string but I don't know the place of the string.

What is the command for that one??
