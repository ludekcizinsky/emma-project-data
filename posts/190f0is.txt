COMMENT TEXT: Just because ports are open to the Internet does equal a vulnerability.

Open ports are necessary for communications from outside.

If you want to try to identify the owner, start with this:

COMMENT TEXT: You don’t do anything.   You did not have permission to scan.   Unauthorized port scanning is pretty far from ethical.

COMMENT TEXT: It works on IPs - could be individuals, could be companies, could be the government, could be the ISP.

You have to do the lookup to determine.

COMMENT TEXT: It's not supposed to. For an individual, their ISP likely owns that IP address if there is an issue with a port being open, you reach out to the ISP via proxy to notify their customer.
