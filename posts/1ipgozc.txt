POST ID: 1ipgozc / POST TITLE: Human Risk Management or just Security awareness 2.0?
====================================================================================================
I work for a reseller, and a few of our larger customers have started asking about human risk management (HRM) solutions. Most of them came across the concept in a recent Gartner report and are now pushing to move beyond basic security awareness training.

It’s interesting to see how legacy vendors like KnowBe4, SANS, and others have rebranded to jump on the HRM bandwagon, but I’m curious - what *truly innovative* solutions have you seen in this space?

We’ve been working with a company called OutThink, and their approach feels like a step ahead of the usual offerings, but I’d love to hear what others are doing.

How many of you have CISOs / CIOs asking for more proactive approaches to human risk, that go beyond the basics? Are you seeing this shift too? How many of you have CISOs / CIOs asking for more mature, proactive approaches to human risk? What’s working for you, what’s falling short, and where do you see HRM heading in the next year or two?
