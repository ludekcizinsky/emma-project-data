====================================================================================================
Hi all,

As the title states, how do I break into cyber security role from a help desk manager role? I've been doing MSP work for about less than 3 years and have moved up to what is pretty much the highest level I can go in my company. I have a AS in cyber security and the CompTIA Security +. I'm finding it hard to figure out the next steps in where I can go from here since applying to security roles haven't gone well. I've read plenty of reddit posts about finishing my degree and getting a handful of certs. With all of these posts pointing to different certs its a bit hard to figure out which one has more of a bigger impact. What are the next best steps to break in to the cyber space?
