Hey I am 23 and want to switch my career to Cybersec from Architecture. I have no bachelor's degree so I want know about what certifications should I go for?

2. CCNA
3. CEH
4. eJPT
5. OSCP

COMMENT TEXT: Bro Cyber security is a very vast field, you have to decide, in which sub field you have to specialise? If you are cool with networking security, cyber Ops, etc go with CCNA and at least till CCNP, if you want to learn penetration testing or bug bounty hunting go for OSCP.

COMMENT TEXT: Heath Adams PNPT is a great stepping stone certification. If you get that and then OSCP it will greatly improve your chances of landing a job, however, you will still be competing with people with more experience so keep that in mind. You will need to be able to discuss various penetration testing topics and mitigation strategies during your interview. Most penetration testing jobs Iâ€™ve done are consulting roles.
