Wiresharkâ€™d and did some recon on my school internet  because I was bored. Found that a 172.///.///./// server from California was sending tons of quic packets to our school. Was wondering if it was a massive download or an underpowered ddos. I reported it to IT, and did some research on quic packets and found that it was pretty intense on the network. Just wondering what I could have done to investigate further?

most likely some server side stuff.

not much else without explicit permission from your school. i'd even be wary about doing passive scans.
