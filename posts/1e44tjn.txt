POST ID: 1e44tjn / POST TITLE: Book recommendations 
====================================================================================================
I recently read a book called Hacking: The Art of Exploitation by Jon Erickson. It was fantastic, the sort of book where the author knows the subject so well that they communicate more than just the words, if that makes sense.

Looking for any similar reads to this, if anyone knows any?
