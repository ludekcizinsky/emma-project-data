POST ID: 1iolh4s / POST TITLE: Is it common for fintech companies to be wary of using Password managers?
====================================================================================================
I was speaking to someone in the fintech space and they mentioned that their IT director (or someone high-up) has a mandate against using any password manager technology for the organization.

Supposedly their team handles a lot of money and they generate passwords and share them with the whole team verbally. The team then memorizes this password and uses as needed.

To me its already a red-flag that a whole team has access to a single account without any controls/audit of who actually accessed the account. However, I understand the not-storing the password in a password-manager for very-specific use-cases could be a beneficial strategy.

What seems odd to me is that the IT director for a fortune 1000 company has a blanket "no password manager" policy across the company and that they are actively discouraging the use of them.

Has anyone else encountered this in their careers?

The end result of this is the person I was speaking to swears by never using a password manager and instead has their own mechanism to remember passwords for all their accounts like an easy to remember cipher.
