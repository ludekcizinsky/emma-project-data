====================================================================================================
Hello, 21 year old senior college student here looking for project ideas for my Ethical Hacking class that donâ€™t require a lot of time since the deadline is in January. I am not experienced in hacking and this will be my first independent project. 
Thank you in advance

COMMENT TEXT: Uhh any guidelines for the project? A great project world be to build an AD environment and then exploit the default configurations. Add in ADCS if you have time.
