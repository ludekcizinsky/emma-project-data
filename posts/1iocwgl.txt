POST ID: 1iocwgl / POST TITLE: Cisco Cyber Ops Professor Messer Equivalent?
====================================================================================================
Looking for good video content for Cisco cyber ops exam study and other good resources. Passed sec+ with score around 850, will it be harder? It seems like a lot of the same type of questions, what is the major difference between the two? What do employers value about the certificate? What was your experience taking the exam (was it online, harder/easier than study/leaked questions)?
