COMMENT TEXT: Not that much of a reach.  Had a user get sent a html file to download a .exe and when the .exe wouldn't run got coached by the phisher how to bypass app locker.  Raised no red flags with the user

Never overestimate the user

COMMENT TEXT: So you need to craft a UDL then convince the user to open it for it to send a hash, or convince them to type in their password for it to send the creds in plain text?

What is the advantage here? Is it that the file is not flagged as malicious, whereas a custom exe might be? Wouldnâ€™t a .lnk file work in the same way?

COMMENT TEXT: So you need a user to double-click the file and when presented with a dialog never before seen by the user, you also need to convince them to press the 'test connection' button? Kinda a hard sell as a phishing method.
