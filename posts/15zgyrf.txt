COMMENT TEXT: So pentest+ will get you no where. It's a joke and I havent heard a single company ask for or even hire someone with it. I went and did TCM PNPT for $300 and that got me a job as a junior pentester plus time in cybersecurity.

COMMENT TEXT: You are going nowhere. Certs get you a call, then they hear how dumb you sound, then no interview.

COMMENT TEXT: I'm from the US. I'm telling you you need one of the following to get hire in this field, PNPT, OSCP, maybe the HTB cert but haven't seen it much. I did PNPT first and I'm about to do OSCP finally and I have found the Active Directory part a complete breeze for the labs. PNPT is much more in depth with AD which has helped me greatly in my job as a pentester.

COMMENT TEXT: Pnpt all the way! The eCPPT is another good option since you’ve already finished the eJPT and are used to INE training.
