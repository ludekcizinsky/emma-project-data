POST ID: 1iq3vk2 / POST TITLE: Getting back into the game…
====================================================================================================
A couple of years ago, I invested a lot of time and money into trying to break into cybersecurity. I completed the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity, got stuck into TryHackMe, and networked with loads of people on LinkedIn. But then life happened, and all of that fell by the wayside.

Now, career wise, I’m in a hands-on role that sits somewhere between a systems administrator and data governance position. I work with various partners, so I still have some technical exposure, but it’s not really cybersecurity, although I do have exposure to SIEMs etc.

I’m at a point where I want to get back into it, but I’m not sure how. Do I just start again? Pick up where I left off? Is there anything you’d recommend for someone in my position?

Would love to hear from anyone who’s been in a similar situation or has advice on how to get back in the game.
