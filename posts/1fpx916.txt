POST ID: 1fpx916 / POST TITLE: Cybersecurity from scratch?
====================================================================================================
Hello , I am currently pursuing my second year of B.Tech in Computer Science. I am not enjoying my college life at all. The 9 to 4 college routine, the teachers, and my classmates are all demotivating me. It is not because of the subjects because I enjoyed studying the same subjects during my diploma in CS. I am interested in the cybersecurity field and want to learn everything from scratch about cybersecurity while somehow managing my B.Tech degree. I am feeling dumb while doing B.Tech. Please help me; what should I do?

COMMENT TEXT: Yup! Remember to get get a vm on a separate computer, just to be safe! As others have said, proxy chaining is useful as well but takes time to set up effectively.
