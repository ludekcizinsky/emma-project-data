Documentation of John the Ripper refer frequently to literally “-jumbo”.   What does “-jumbo” string stand for?  For the jumbo version of JtR rather than, for instance, john command line option?

COMMENT TEXT: John the Ripper Jumbo refers to a special edition of the software that significantly expands its capabilities. Here's what  John the Ripper Jumbo offers:

* **Extended Hash Support:** The standard version of John the Ripper supports a decent range of password hash types. However, Jumbo brings a significant advantage by adding hundreds of additional hashes and ciphers to its cracking arsenal. This empowers it to tackle a much wider variety of password formats encountered in different systems and applications.

* **Examples:** The Jumbo version can handle hashes used by:
    - Various Unix flavors (Linux, *BSD, Solaris, etc.)
    - macOS and Windows password formats
    - Web applications (e.g., WordPress)
    - Groupware (e.g., Notes/Domino)
    - Database servers (SQL, LDAP)
    - Encrypted filesystems and disks
    - Archives (ZIP, RAR)
 
* Essentially, Jumbo makes John the Ripper a more versatile tool for password auditing and recovery across diverse environments.
