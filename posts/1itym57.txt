PocketPrep for SecurityX (CASP+) ?

Hello All,



I have been doing a CBTNuggets course to prepare me for SecurityX (formally CASP+). I have been doing 90 question quizzes using PocketPrep and am doing really great. I took a simulated Exam for CASP on Kaplan Learn and only got a 60. Is PocketPrep not giving me good metrics or is Kaplan known to be very hard? Any insight is great, pocket prep has gotten me through other exams so Iâ€™m curious what everyone thinks in regards to SecurityX.
