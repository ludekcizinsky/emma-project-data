POST ID: 1iogcak / POST TITLE: Advice on SOC Certifications
====================================================================================================
Hi,

I’m looking for some advice on which SOC certifications would be most beneficial for my career.

A bit of background about me, I’ve been working as a SOC Analyst for the past three years, and I’m considering leaving my current company. Before I do, I’d like to take advantage of the certification opportunities my employer provides.

I want to focus on certifications that will make my CV stand out and enhance my skill set. Based on my research, I’ve come across the following options:

CompTIA CySA+

OSCP

Security Blue Team Level 2

OffSec Defense Analyst (OSDA)

Hack The Box Certified Defense Security Analyst (HTB CDSA)

Which of these would you recommend, and are there any others that you think would be particularly valuable for someone in my position?

Thanks in advance for your guidance!
