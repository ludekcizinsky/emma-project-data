Cyware is a website that combines articles from many tech sites to form a centralized center for what's going on in the world of cybersecurity. The only issue is the vulnerabilities posted are somewhat vague (as to not release a zero day PoC publicly) and usually a day later than most tech sites.

It gives you an idea of what's currently being exploited with some details for how it's being done. For details, you'd have to search the specific vulnerability or CVE for more information.

As of this posting, ObjCShellz Malware is targeting MacOS systems.
