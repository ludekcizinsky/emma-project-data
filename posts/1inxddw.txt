Is anyone else having issues getting any interviews or even call backs for I.T. positions? I feel like I have applied to everything under the sun and cant get a call back. Ive worked 4 years as a network security administrator under a telecommunications company and only want to change because they dont pay industry average. I will be completing my bachelors degree in June in Cybersecurity and information assurance. I dont know if its my resume, cover letter, or experience. I have the passion and hunger to learn and advance my career. Does anyone have any recommendations on places to start in the industry or someone can look over my resume a little bit? Is anyone else experiencing these things?
