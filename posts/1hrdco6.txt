COMMENT TEXT: Question - Why do web app pentesters need to be able to travel domestically and internationally? Why do the pentesters have to be in Charlston but Project Managers can be remote?


Honest questions after looking at the job site 🙂

COMMENT TEXT: If I had to guess, it's probably have to do with the clients. I worked with companies where they want people to work on their stuff locally rather than on the cloud. Internationally make sense due to different legal laws. 


Project Managers probably never have to look at an actual product vs the pentesters.


In my current position, we have like 10% travel both domestically and internationally. (Maybe like once or twice a year but it happens)
