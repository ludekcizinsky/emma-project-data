POST ID: 1io29r0 / POST TITLE: Network and identity microsegmentation in the cloud
====================================================================================================
Hi,

I recently joined a big enterprise that has a huge cloud environment (new to me) along with a traditional network. The on-prem network is obviously segmented into different subnets, and we also have a POC with a micro-segmentation vendor for it to limit lateral movement.

In the cloud, it seems like there are 2 frontiers - network and identity. Getting access to a role with access to a resource makes it accessible from pretty much anywhere (from an attackers endpoint for example).  
The vendor we are looking at only takes into account the network aspect.

I'm wondering how do you approach network and identity lateral movement risks in the cloud?  
1) Is network micro-segmenting in the cloud something worth looking into?  
2) Do you enforce role policies so they can only be assumed from specific resources, using IAM Trust Relationships for example? (essentially "identity microsegmentation")

  
Thanks for reading!
