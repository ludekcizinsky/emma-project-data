POST ID: 1iunco8 / POST TITLE: Do people buy old CISSP books? Or do they go out of date after a year or so?
====================================================================================================
Hi! Just wondering if it's worth the effort of trying to sell old CISSP books. I have the 7th edition of the CISSP for Dummies book, the third edition of the CISSP practice tests book, and the ninth edition of the Shon Harris book. They're all around 2-3 years old I think. Should I bother? If not, what would you do with them?
