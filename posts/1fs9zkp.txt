POST ID: 1fs9zkp / POST TITLE:  Seeking Ideas for FOSS Offensive Security Tool in Rust 
====================================================================================================
Hello,

I'm a freelance web developer currently enrolled on HTB Academy with the goal of pursuing certifications like OSCP and eventually transitioning into offensive security as a career. To build up my portfolio and enhance my skills, I'm looking to create an open-source offensive security tool using Rust.

My goals for this project are to:

1. Create a useful tool for the security community
2. Avoid duplicating existing tools unless significant improvements can be made
3. Practice and showcase Rust programming
4. Build a relevant portfolio piece for my transition into offensive security

Some initial ideas I've considered:

* A faster alternative to dnsenum
* An improved version of gobuster

I'm open to completely new ideas or suggestions for existing tools that could benefit from a Rust implementation with performance improvements.

I appreciate any insights, ideas, or feedback you can provide. Thank you!

But rust is awesome for red teaming. What about something cloud related? Like aws og azure ? Or some tool that could automate and integrate multiple AD tools like get AD CS errors, kerberroastable and as-rep roastable accounts and tickets etc.
