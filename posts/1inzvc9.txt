POST ID: 1inzvc9 / POST TITLE: Does anyone have a list of commonly used AI/GPT services today?
====================================================================================================
I'm planning an audit of our organization's usage of unvetted AI platforms on corporate-managed end-points and I was wondering if there was a list floating around I could use as a starting point for my analysis. I figure I could probably just look for websites categorized as AI by Zscaler but I'd like to have a secondary check also.
