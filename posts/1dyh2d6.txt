POST ID: 1dyh2d6 / POST TITLE: AUTOMOD IS IN EFFECT
====================================================================================================
Good news everyone, We have the automoderator up and running. currently its set to delete posts from brand new users (that are like less than a day old, we may adjust this), users with 0 or negative karma, remove comments and posts that contain some banned keywords (who remembers that time we were getting spammed with crypto bullshit? yeah, no more).

in addition to post and comments that are attempting to look for, hire, or offer the services of a hacker in any kind of way, based on keywords will be removed. if any slip through please message the moderator team so we can look at it and refine the list

another auto mod removal feature, is it will remove posts with just a title only and nothing in the body, we consider this being lazy, put some effort into your posts as giving more information will allow us as a community to help you better, (most regular users here don't have to worry about this).

  
If any of your posts or comments were removed, and you feel it was done in error please message the moderator team so we can take a look at it and see if it was a valid removal or if it was done in error. this also applies if you have any additional feedback on how we can refine the automod, such as adding rules or lessening the restriction on others let us know.

COMMENT TEXT: yeah, thats one of the reasons why i applied to moderate this subreddit. even after its like 10-20 posts a week of people looking for hackers. we will probably still see a few of them, and if you do let us know so we can refine the automod code a little bit to catch them better.
