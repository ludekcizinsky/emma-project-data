COMMENT TEXT: Article is just a sales pitch. 
Maybe pentesting does need a new name now since theres so many "automated" pentests

COMMENT TEXT: Not even a really good sales pitch.  Most large Companies invite ethical hacking.  Pen-testing has its place.  Networks change everyday.  Pen-testing checks to make sure the doors are closed and locked.  Internal and external validations are needed to ensure compliance but is not an every day event.

COMMENT TEXT: Hacking is hacking. Bug bounties are still hacking, but you get paid a bounty for the bugs you find. Ethical hacking still hacking, but not illegally.
They are doing pentesting which is professional hacking that business hire people to do, but company is labelling their manual pentesting as "ethical hacking".
