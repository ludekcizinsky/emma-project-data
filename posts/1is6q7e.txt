POST ID: 1is6q7e / POST TITLE: Exploit Found in Elon Muskâ€™s X Allows Unauthorized Access to Grok-3 AI
====================================================================================================
A newly discovered exploit in Elon Muskâ€™s X platform allows users to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to Grok-3 AI by manipulating client-side code.

**How the Exploit Works:**

* A JavaScript snippet modifies the window object in the browser, searching for references to "grok-2a" and replacing them with "grok-3".
* Running the script in the browser console before starting a new chat tricks the system into granting access to Grok-3 features.
* The exploit takes advantage of poor client-side security, bypassing intended restrictions.

**Security Violation:**

This attack violates [Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/), one of the most critical security flaws. Instead of enforcing access restrictions server-side, the system relies on client-side controls, making it vulnerable to manipulation.

**Why This Matters:**

* Unauthorized users gain access to restricted AI features.
* Client-side security flaws expose vulnerabilities in Xâ€™s AI platform.
* Proper access control should be handled server-side to prevent exploitation.

*Exploiting this vulnerability may violate Xâ€™s terms of service and pose security risks.*
