POST ID: 1iuuinc / POST TITLE: Hacking drones, less science fiction than you think.
====================================================================================================
With the prevalence of drones and UAVs in today's world, there was only a matter of time before someone figured out how to hack these machines while they are in use. It seems as if the concept of hacking a drone mid-flight is no longer a concept and more of a reality. Several countries are at risk of being hacked, the United Kingdoms and Iran, and offer a new avenue for attack in case of conflict. What reality do you think will come of these discoveries?
