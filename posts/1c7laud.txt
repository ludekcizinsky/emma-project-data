POST ID: 1c7laud / POST TITLE: What should do for learning 
====================================================================================================
Hello, I'm seeking guidance on my journey to become a cybersecurity and ethical hacker. While I have a background as a network technician and some programming skills, I acknowledge they need improvement. I've heard that certifications are crucial for success in this field, such as CISSP, OSCP, CEH, CompTIA Network+, and CompTIA Security+. Despite knowing it will be a significant investment, I'm deeply committed to learning.I've been actively immersing myself in cybersecurity literature, watching tutorials on YouTube to understand different tools, and learning to navigate Kali Linux. However, I've hit a roadblock and feel stuck in my progress. Any advice on how to overcome this hurdle would be immensely appreciated
