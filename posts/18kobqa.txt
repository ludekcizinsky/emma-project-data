POST ID: 18kobqa / POST TITLE: Any suggestions for simple, freelance tech work??
====================================================================================================
I've been wondering if it could be realistic/practical to try and learn/make some money on the side with freelance ethical hacking/IT work. I was looking at [Upwork.com](https://Upwork.com), but idk if it would be worth the effort. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could possibly start doing freelance tech work online and hopefully learn a bit of ethical hacking in the process?
