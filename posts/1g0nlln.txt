COMMENT TEXT: actually you are me.. Im at final year or my high school as well. Checkout youtubers like networkchuck,davidbombal,cyber mentor for learning concepts and to get a hands on experience.. basically, start from networking and learn languages like c,python. and then advance to learning kali linux and its tools... You'll get an idea as you watch those mentioned youtubers. Good luck
