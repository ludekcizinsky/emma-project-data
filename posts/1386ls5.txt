COMMENT TEXT: Check the pinned thread ‚ÄúResources for beginners‚Äù. There are no specific things on mobile hacking. It you‚Äôll need to learn a lot of the foundations before even getting into that. The foundations are in that list. Go forth and onward.

COMMENT TEXT: You need to understand a lot of basic stuff before even getting into security I would start with a low level job like helpdesk first to get an understanding of the world of IT. But if you want to go it through tutorials it would be doable but you need to know your basic level shit well first
