POST ID: 1isrs5u / POST TITLE: MSRT in addition to Crowdstrike
====================================================================================================
We run Crowdstrike Falcon on our endpoints, but I've been testing rolling out MSRT to those endpoints also, and automating a full MSRT scan once/week on every endpoint. This would be supplemental protection and from my tests it doesn't interfere with crowdstrike.

Does anyone have any experience running multiple EDR's on their endpoints? Thank you in advance for your help.
