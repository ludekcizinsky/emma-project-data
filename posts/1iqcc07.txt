POST ID: 1iqcc07 / POST TITLE: Help Needed for Comparative Analysis of Open Source SIEMs in the Cloud
====================================================================================================
Hello everyone,

I’m new to cybersecurity and I'm currently doing a project on a comparative analysis of a few open source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools in a cloud environment. So far, I’ve identified Wazuh,ELK Stack and OSSIM to include in my analysis. I’m looking for recommendations on 2-3 other popular open-source SIEMs that would be suitable for this project.

Additionally, I need advice on which cloud platform that would be best for this project. Preferably one that would typically be used for a small organization. I’m considering options like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, but I’d love to hear your suggestions based on ease of use and suitability for my project.

I’ve noticed that there aren’t many resources available that cover the integration of open source SIEMs into the cloud, so any guidance would be greatly appreciated.

Moreover, I would like to know what specific aspects I should focus on for this project. What kinds of logs should I collect, and what types of attacks can I simulate in the cloud to test how the SIEMs respond? I want to keep the project manageable as I'm still a beginner, so any tips on scoping it effectively would be helpful!

Thank you in advance for your insights!
