COMMENT TEXT: There is a lot of tutorials and templates out there. 

[here](https://marker.io/blog/how-to-write-bug-report) is one.

Tl;Dr

- Short description of bug
- Steps to reproduce the bug
- Expected result (what should happen normally)
- Actual result (the result that shows when the bug happens)
- Proof of Bug (screenshot, dump files etc.)
- Additional info and environment (Device, software, versions, proof of concept exploits etc. ...)

In essence, a bug report like this one is solely to give the Team at apple good information as to where the bug is, how to trigger it and what it does, so they can more effectively find, reproduce and fix it.

Edit: obviously also include your name and contact info. The way you want to write the report isnt lengthy, but it has to be very detailed technically. 
The more info they get, the better.
