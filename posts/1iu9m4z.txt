COMMENT TEXT: Nothing to do with cyber except in label. About as much to do with cyber as the movie world war z resembled the book. 

Fine show for entertainment if you like uspol based drama thrillers. Not if you're looking for real world cyber ops or spy craft.

COMMENT TEXT: I‚Äôm sitting in a darkened room watching episode 2. I find it hard to concentrate on the story because it‚Äôs so dark I can hardly see what‚Äôs going on. 

Even the scene where the president‚Äôs wife is walking outside on a sunny day looks like it‚Äôs being lit by moonlight. 

Anyone else seeing this?

COMMENT TEXT: everybody here saying cyber security is boring, series is boring and the script is bad? shows how many of the people here are ignorant, with huge ego and think highly of themselves honestly. The series portrays a lot of truth about whats been happening in our daily lives. Cyber security is not boring  and it should be something most should be aware of and be concerned! This series is a wake up call, a touch of reality, self check and empowerment. a lot of people here judging already and saying theyre not watching roberts movie anymore or they just watched one episode and telling people its bad?. BS tbh lol

COMMENT TEXT: Is this Show some kind of trump propaganda? The old president to come back and safe the country from the corrupt administration that falsely suspect Russian for something terrible? The tv host kinda feels like a mixture of John Oliver and Tucker Carlson. Though no idea how it really fits. The current president seems to resemble Kamala Harris. I‚Äôm just halfway through and English is not my first language. So could be that I‚Äôm missing relevant things or see things that are not really shown.

COMMENT TEXT: I just started to rewatch that. The first episode had me pretty baffled when they were like "wow it's a DDOS attack! We're completely compromised! It's super advanced, we can't tell how they're pulling this off!" Like I get later on it was used as cover for the actual breach, but that was still Elliot's reaction to being shown a DDOS.

COMMENT TEXT: Every potential threat has been sensationalized by Hollywood. SNAKES ON A PLANE!? THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW? JAWS?!

An actual obvious example is Leave the World Behind which plays on the fear that the US has made so many enemies that war hungry countries are collaborating to take down the US with multiple new age war tactics that the US doesn‚Äôt have the intelligence or capabilities to prepare for or handle. 

Sensationalism of cyber security ineptitudes (or any threat for that matter) is a double edged sword. While it‚Äôs one of the only ways to get blinded people to recognize a problem that exists (the US is not as ahead as it should be to detect and manage cyber threats from e.g., China), it also plays on the social media sharing, YouTube watching ‚Äúsheep‚Äù who can‚Äôt separate fact from fiction and are triggered by fear to perpetuate BS.

This show establishes ineptitude. Guessing games. Inside corruption. A bunch of ‚Äúwhoops‚Äù. Inability to solve immediate problems (banks not being accessible). But there‚Äôs a weird amount of empathy? But the empathy comes across as ignorance.

COMMENT TEXT: No, it‚Äôs the opposite. This was clearly filmed before the election with the assumption that Kamala Harris would be president right now. De Niro is supposed to be portraying a mixture of Biden/Obama/McCain in a post-Trump world where republicans and democrats work with each other again. The ‚Äúautistic billionaire‚Äùlady is supposed to be Elon Musk who‚Äôs funding and providing the tech for a hostile takeover and removal of civil liberties. (This doesn‚Äôt really strike the right tone though however because it‚Äôs too similar to what‚Äôs going on currently, except the real president is in on it so there‚Äôs no commission to investigate or arrest him)

COMMENT TEXT: People struggle hard to get into government positions in NK as any job there pretty much are rockstar positions in that society, so that some would be "born" into a role is not true. The likelihood of anyone becoming proficient in offensive cyber security from the government approved information on their intranet, are close to zero.

COMMENT TEXT: I think death-by-cyber-attack is a powerful, and deeply relevant plot element that most Americans find interesting to watch and thought-provoking, but this show didn‚Äôt go far enough. Maybe it‚Äôs difficult to realistically portray the entire country being without power or without access to our funds, but everyone was acting way too calm. Leave the World Behind was better because it portrayed nationwide panic more accurately.

Having spent 20+ years in cyber, it is 95% corporate/government boring and repetitive and 5% SHF stuff.
