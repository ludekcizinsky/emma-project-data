POST ID: 1imu9kv / POST TITLE: Talking to investors or the public about your cyber security strategy
====================================================================================================
After studying data breaches and seeing how little effort some companies put into security, it makes me wonder what the best way to learn about a company's cyber strategy is.

Do you ever get approached by people who want to know about your cyber strategy? What could you say to them that would be useful without revealing too much?
