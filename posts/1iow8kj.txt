POST ID: 1iow8kj / POST TITLE: Governance Risk and Compliance Tools Recommendation
====================================================================================================
New to cybersecurity area!

 Evaluating GRC tools as per boss requirements and have shortlisted Vanta, Drata, Onetrust and trustero (among the ones I knew).

Looking for recommendations for these tools over few keys areas that am comparing them for.

Will appreciate everyoneâ€™s feedback on your experience with these tools for below areas:

1. Internal Team/IT Owners: How easy is it to onboard IT application owners on these tools so that can add control related evidence 

2. Control/Evidence: Ease to collecting evidence for all controls and ability to add new controls or modify recommended ones

3. Integrations: What out of the box integrations does these tools have?

4. Pricing: We have two different groups. One is like a startup with very few employees and one person doing all work.
Other is around 10 application owners each managing between 2 to 5 applications.
Both groups fund their own licenses.

5. Auditor interface for these tools

Please share any other tools experience or details that would help me

Cheers
Sam
