Hello, I'm J, I'm glad you are interested in joining the ethical hacking community. Have no idea where to start? Don't panic we've all been there, this post will guide you on your first steps into the ethical hacking field.

**What is ethical hacking?**

Ethical hacking (or penetration testing) is the exploitation of an IT system with the permission of its owner to determine its vulnerabilities and weak points. It is an effective way of testing and validating an organisation’s cyber security position.

**Where can I learn ethical hacking?**

Ok, slow down, Do you have a computing background or familiar with how they work (you would be susprised at the amount have zero knowledge and jump into this field)?

Yes - great. I suggest you have a look at getting certfications. These certs require you to study up to a certain level then taking an exam. This allows for you and future employers (which really like certs) to see your skill level and potential. This is the [certification roadmap](https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/) by Paul Jerimy which shows the route you should take, if you feel that skilled enough you could skip up and do higher certs. A great way to practice your skills is through [tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/) and [hackthebox](https://hackthebox.eu). These are free online platforms (with some optional paid sections) that give you access to systems found irl that give you permissions to practice your skills. Some resources below might be in interest for you listed below.

No - Dont worry, You may find certifications a little difficult to jump into at first unless you are determined enough to spend a lot of time studying. I suggest you go out and learn a little, dont let this put you off as this an extremely interesting field with endless knowledge that will continue to evolve forever. Check out the resources below for study content.

I purchased 3 courses from Zaid when they were on special. I have to say the Learn Ethical hacking from scratch was disappointing. The first half was good but the second half rushed and wasn't explained as well . I wonder other 2 courses will be the same. I might try the Cyber Mentor course on YouTube.

Idk if it would be of help but I have recently started learning ethical hacking on an app called hackerx because a friend of a friend recommended it to me, I myself have only done the first few lesson which were pretty beginner friendly and had a decent rating on playstore, so if u guys wanna learn it too i'd suggest to just check it out once-

  
Then I also came across an ethical hacking playlist by David Bombal which seemed pretty cool although I have just seen the video on installing Kali Linux yet-

lanpbuj / 1.0 / ethicalhacking
Hello all,


I hope this is believed - but I'm not new to the idea of hacking(not cracking, tho I also once knew a bit of bomb making and phreaking on dial-up but thankfully too young to ever practise any of it 20-30 years ago). Also took me quite a while to understand the 'warez' of softwares despite knowing it for a good year or two back then(tbh I was downloading mostly legit, on Tucows and with GetRight etcetc!)


I believe I'm in the correct place as per rule 5, but maybe I am not. I haven't 'hacked' anything for decades(and even then it was only really my home computer and windows and graphics and maybe ROM sprites of old video games - which I definitely 100% had a right to do so from).


In the UK there was a brilliant documentary last night by Channel 4(not an inventive name I realise but go figure about the times) via their 'Dispatches' series that used a variety of methods to create deepfakes in order to influence undecided voters(it's a bloody great watch - will link in a comment so I don't get this deleted).


I have been trying to tell my mum, my dad, and tbh every other tom dick and Harry for years about disinformation/misinformation. I called my mum shortly after the programme to ask her thoughts and it seemed it had opened her eyes, at least a little bit.


Now, I'm curious(and I'm happy to use tools that label what I'm doing as fake, as it's the obvious way of ethics) - I said to her what if I created a 'deepfake' of her what would she think about it? Or if I managed to created one also if my dad(he didn't watch it, but they spoke about it).


Apparently these things can now be done in almost no time at all, with barely less than 2 minutes of audio, or even better with video, or a mishmash of the two - and also in less than minutes itself! I have her consent to try to do so, and I would like to try attempting it now(and she has challenged me to such) - but how and where would I go about this most immediately via the most ethical and useful means? I'd be 100% happy to use anything that clearly labels what I create as a fake, if not even 110% happy to do so so that it is never ever used otherwise.


Before I turn to easy and traditional sources of doing this via a quick Google(which may end up with a similar result as I doubt much deepfake' software watermarks itself as fake) - is there any good suggestions from anybody in the community on how I could go about this?


Ideally I would like to create a 'deepfake' audio for her to pretend she said stuff in a phone call, but then as well I would also like to create a video 'deepfake' of her to send and show her both these things - as well as explaining my process and the time it took me - to kinda of help extra/add on top of her interest in being skeptical about too many things you read/see/hear(thankfully she's not very internet savvy, but she is now on Whatsapp, and I'm also trying to warn her there of boomer memes etc and disinfo easily being shared and spread - I think creating a deepfake of HER would really highlight the point and she actually was interested in whether I actually could and whether people would even believe it).


Can anyone help me in this pursuit in the most ethical way without me having to go down further routes? Again I'm absolutely happy to use anything that marks it as fake, or I'll be adding that disclaimer too, but she said if I could create it then let's see - so I said if I can create it she can herself then try sharing it with others to test whether they believe it or not, in a way to challenge her own beliefs.


tl;Dr - what is the most ethical way for me to make a deepfake audio or video of somebody and what would I require from them?


(Again I realise how fucking dodgy this sounds as a random noob to the forum, but I assure I'm old school 1337 and ethical, but I appreciate skepticism too and also whether this question cannot be answered. I did once learn a few things under Professor Chris French, a famous skeptic and comraderie of James Randi - so I like to spend my time DISproving things and fake beliefs. And happy if need to answer questions before I get my own answer, or to be told that I won't be told how to do this here, as well).


Thanks in advance,
Me.

Does it make sense for a 40 year old without much in depth computer background to start getting into this? I’ve never learned had a career in a trying. Just worked jobs. I do have some basic knowledge but not enough so I’d probably have to get a degree in IT first. But I do wonder if it makes sense at my age. Any suggestions?

I am also having difficulties in understanding most concepts and I'm simply following some procedures taught in my penetration testing course. I really need advice on this topic... 🙂

Can anyone outline some steps or processes I would have to do to find what I imagine is server side information on my account? As in, surely there's some sort of "ID" outside of my chosen screen name and email in the account database, on the company's side. Like Reddit for example, or BattleNet, or EA.
  

  
My endgame goal here is to change a game account status to active from banned. No I don't expect this process to take a few minutes, or hours, or days, probably not even weeks. But help me start in the basics?

This is ethical reasons because it affects me only me.

Hi friends,
I am an IT forensic scientist and just finished my advanced training to become a Data Scientist.

Now I want to develop myself in the direction of Ethical Hacking, because I think it can be helpful in my job and maybe open new possibilities.

Now I am considering investing in the TCM Security Academy in the monthly access.

Do any of you professionals have experience with this? Would you recommend it?

Thank you

This is a very well-known concept, with the help of which anyone can become a hero from zero in the ethical hacking field....you just need to have dedication. There should be a passion to do it..Trust yourself don't ask any other person what is right for you.

I'm also learning Ethical hacking so if you want to learn then you are most welcome to learn together and exchange our knowledge with dedication and become a pro-ethical hacker.

in0aokd / 1.0 / ethicalhacking
I am enrolled in their ethical hacker program as we speak. It is pricey, but legit. If you are a student pursuing a degree, they offer pretty hefty discounts to apply towards one of their certificate programs. I paid right around $1,000 for the CEH, which normally runs $4000 or so(ish).

in0cb7v / 1.0 / ethicalhacking
It’s rarely happens like that. One certification CAN land you a job, and you should pursue certifications. However, if you look at job requirements for positions that you might be interested in, they rarely list just one certification/skill  as a requirement. You should look at companies/jobs on job boards and see what they would “like you to have”, and what they “require.” See what they require and learn those skills. If you have zero to limited real world skills/experience in the arena, focus on acquiring the skills and landing a job, the “high pay” will come.

From someone who tried using it on a USB, if you do so, use a really good USB drive with high storage because otherwise, your OS will run at snail's pace.

It is best to use a virtual machine or dual boot. I would personally use a virtual machine as dual booting opens you up to security vulnerabilities.

More experienced people can comment if I'm wrong cs I'm  relatively new to this as well.

I'm a manipulative bastard at times.. Especially in my active addiction i can see myself making a borderline nonsense rant post like this. I wouldn't even actually have a child.. I'd just post that in hopes I can persuade someone to exact revenge on my ex because i lack the necessary skills and to keep a degree of deniability. Your kid is 7 (supposedly). Get her off the babysitter tablet and spend some actual time cultivating an actual relationship with her. Your ex probably isn't a proficient hacker. A cheater? Probably maybe. But not a hacker. Not many women would have the necessary skillset, nor the interest. Just my 4 cents.
